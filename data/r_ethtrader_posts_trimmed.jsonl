{"selftext":"As the U.S government nears a shutdown and lawmakers race against midnight deadline, federal agencies are making final preparations.\n\nCrypto prices have edged higher as we are leading into the midnight deadline, on relatively light volumes. Bitcoin hovers around $27,000.\n\nWhat do we do? Well before we panic,\n as per the history, there have actually been 14 shutdowns since 1980. Any time the government has shut down for over nine days, the S &P 500 has declined 0 .7 % in that month and then went up around 3 % in the three months after. \n\nBitcoin could be on the cusp of a significant price surge if the US government experiences a shutdown beginning on October 1, 2023. This prediction is based on historical precedents where Bitcoin experienced a rally during times of financial uncertainty. The connection between Bitcoin's prices and the decisions of the Federal Reserve is well documented. Yet, the king has consistently thrived during US government shutdowns and banking crises. Additionally, cryptocurrency experts speculate that if Bitcoin manages to breach the $30,000  mark, it could trigger a psychological boost among traders. This surge might be attributed to the looming cloud of fear, uncertainty, and doubt, FUD, cast by the US government closure. \n\nSo what should we do now?","title":"U.S government is getting Shutdown!

{"selftext":"A bit of a self-story here; but during COVID lockdowns, I was out of work for a period of time - and thats when I began to be more active in crypto-subs, then discovering the whole concept of RCP's.\n\nNot only did it help me maintain some form of sanity, by engaging with the community, but it certainly helped me get back on track financially as well.\n\nFrom r\/cryptocurrency Moons, I actually cashed out of some RCP's prior to Easter, and it paid for my Easter weekend holiday - my first Holiday since COVID, my first chosen time off in years. Until then the only time off I had was simply because I was unable to work.\n\nBut if that wasn't enough, through maintaining engagement with the community, I was able to learn and understand a lot more - now I am even able to help others.\n\n**The biggest takeaway though, was the Gateway into DeFi**\n\nBefore I discovered RCP's - I honestly just used a CEX. I eventually looked into some self custody with Exodus, but I still never interacted with any eco-system beyond a simple wallet to wallet transfer to and from the CEX.\n\nRCP's were the gateway for me to start using a hot wallet and interacting with DEX's and DApps, and now I've even taken calculated risks with yield farming\/providing liquidity \nChances are I never would have done taken part into DeFi, providing liquidity or DEX's if not for essentially the \"free\" assets gained via RCP's. \n\nSo for those who have been involved in cryptocurrency for years, keep in mind, there will be plenty of new users to the space, many like me, will start off with using a CEX, but as RCP's become more known, they too could start to really explore the world of DeFi with a relatively low-risk entry thanks to RCP's.\n\nWhether it's Donuts, Moons, or even bricks - it all begins with the awareness and the low-risk curiosity for users to get comfortable with interacting with Crypto.","title":"How Community Points can be the gateway into Crypto","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696129119,"id":"16wpv7e"}

{"selftext":"\n\nEthereum (ETH) is now emerging as a promising asset class for institutional investors, as highlighted by Chris Kuiper, Research Director at Fidelity.\n\nKuiper's latest statement suggests that Ethereum may be gaining an edge over Bitcoin (BTC) in the eyes of institutional players.\n\nThe Maturity of Ethereum as a Protocol\n\nBased on the Crypto Potato report, Kuiper argues that Ethereum has taken significant steps to differentiate itself from Bitcoin, especially in terms of maturity as a protocol.\n\nOne of the key moments in the evolution of Ethereum was the implementation of The Merge upgrade about a year ago.\n\nThis upgrade marks the shift from an energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol.\n\nThe benefits of this switch are huge. Ethereum's energy consumption fell as much as 99 percent, addressing concerns about the environmental impact.\n\nIn addition, this increase significantly reduces the inflation rate of Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. Furthermore, it forms the basis for future scalability improvements through the introduction of sharding.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin updates its protocol much less frequently and does not have a clear development plan or centralized development team.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin's decentralization has been hailed as one of its strengths, ETH's proactive approach to renewal is now increasingly in demand by institutional investors.\n\nThe potential of Ethereum as a form of digital money is getting more and more attention, especially because of the tokenomika deflare Ether (ETH) after The Merge.\n\n\u201cVarious upgrades from Ethereum have made this asset even rarer. This has pushed this kind of value storage attribute potentially more interesting around Ethereum,\" said research analyst at Fidelity Digital Assets, Jack Neureuter.\n\nThis scarcity has sparked interest in Ether as a store of value, similar to the use case of Bitcoin.\n\nDespite this positive development, it is important to acknowledge that Ethereum faces unique challenges. Unlike Bitcoin, ETH lacks the advantage of being a pioneer and extensive network effect.\n\nFrequent updates have led some to doubt its long-term stability and whether it can maintain its position in the crypto landscape.\n\nLooking further than Bitcoin and Ethereum, institutional demand for other cryptos remains relatively low.\n\nKuiper and his team at Fidelity imply that, for many institutions, potential rewards are not worth the risks associated with other digital assets.\n\nThis sentiment is clearly illustrated by Kuiper's statement, which is the result that is not comparable to the effort spent.\n\nCredit: https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/community\/articles\/6518f6e018ba3445416e8662\/","title":"Ethereum Attract Institutional Interest, Here's How","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696145848,"id":"16wutsc"}

{"selftext":"Good day everyone! Today I would like to analyse how traditional financial market events and prices may impact the price of ETH and crypto. I believe when it comes to crypto specific events and tech everyone here is already well versed and getting plenty of information, so I am trying to look at another perspective.\n\nToday\u2019s topic will be on Central Banks monetary policy. We all know that the Federal Reserve monetary policy has a huge impact on financial market, including crypto prices. But there is one more central bank that does not get quite as many headlines but is very important to the global monetary policy situation, which is the Bank of Japan (BOJ).\n\nThe BOJ policy rate has been negative since 2016, and they continued to maintain that even as the Federal Reserve hiked rates above 5% this year, leading to a huge depreciation of the Japanese Yen (JPY) against the USD. If the BOJ however normalizes policy by hiking rates back into positive territory in 2024, we should see a swift appreciation of the Japanese Yen against the USD, and as a result a huge drop in the USD Index.\n\nNow I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cHow on earth is this related to crypto?!\u201d, \u201cRemove this fool\u2019s content!\u201d but wait, bear with me! This is related because ETH is correlated to the USD index. The correlation of USD Index to ETH this year is around -0.53 as at end September, meaning if USD Index goes down, it is more likely for ETH to go up (and vice versa).\n\nBut what exactly is the USD Index? It is an index which tracks the movement of the USD against a basket of 6 currencies with different weightage namely: Euro (57.6%), Japanese Yen (13.6%), British Pound (11.9%), Canadian Dollar (9.1%), Swedish Krona (4.2%) and Swiss Franc (3.6%).\n\nShown below is the estimated USD Index based on data from Tradingview:\n\n|\u00a0**Currency**|**Start 2023**|**End Sep 2023**|**% Change**\u00a0|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**EUR**|1.0704|1.0574|\\-1.21%|\n|**JPY**|131.10|149.37|\\-13.94%|\n|**GBP**|1.2098|1.2204|0.88%|\n|**CAD**|1.3545|1.3581|\\-0.27%|\n|**SEK**|10.4230|10.9266|\\-4.83%|\n|**CHF**|0.9246|0.9148|1.06%|\n|**USD Index**|103.483|106.165|2.59%|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can see that the biggest mover is the Japanese Yen, with the USD gaining 13.94% against it. Even though the Japanese Yen is only 13.6% weightage of the USD index, the move accounts for the 1.79% move higher (out of the 2.59% move) in the USD index as shown below if we keep all values for other currencies constant but only move the Japanese Yen:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|\u00a0**Currency**|**Start 2023**|**Only JPY Moved**|**% Change**\u00a0|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**EUR**|1.0704|1.0704|0.00%|\n|**JPY**|131.10|149.37|\\-13.94%|\n|**GBP**|1.2098|1.2098|0.00%|\n|**CAD**|1.3545|1.3545|0.00%|\n|**SEK**|10.4230|10.4230|0.00%|\n|**CHF**|0.9246|0.9246|0.00%|\n|**USD Index**|103.483|105.335|1.79%|\n\nTherefore the idea is that if BOJ normalizes monetary policy and begins to hike rates, the USD Index will fall significantly when the USD weakens against the Japanese Yen (JPY). The downward move in USD Index will be compounded even further if a BOJ normalization\/hike coincides with the timing of Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\nA drop in USD Index will be an added catalyst to push ETH and crypto higher due to the negative correlation mentioned earlier in the intro, and coupled with ETF approvals (hopefully the ETH spot ETFs) and the Bitcoin halving, all this points to a recipe for a massive bull market starting 2024 and moving into 2025!\n\n(Disclaimer: I am not an \u2018economist\u2019 and this is not financial advice as usual)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","title":"How Global Central Bank Monetary Policy Could Help to Accelerate the Bull Run","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696146592,"id":"16wv0xl"}

{"selftext":"Hello,\n\nAs you already know, MoonsDust and MOOND token are on Binance Smart Chain since the launch in 2021.\nOur main goal was migrating MOOND to Arbitrum Nova once everything about RCPs is clear and stable.\n\nI saw some users spreading fake information that MOOND was rugged and it\u2019s a scam project and that is very unfortunate to hear because it\u2019s quite the opposite- MoonsDust is developing and stronger than ever with RCPswap which is leading Nova DAPP with over 150k users since the launch.\n\nLast week we started the migration to Arbitrum Nova, [with a bridge we built](https:\/\/bridge.moonsdust.com) .\n\nIt\u2019s very important to bridge before the bridge window closes as any unbridged tokens will be lost forever!  That\u2019s why we removed the liquidity on BSC prior to launching the bridge as some users can buy the token for speculation, not be aware about the bridge and eventually lose funds.\n\n\nYou can check MoonsDust.com and Twitter for the official announcement.\n\n\nThanks.","title":"Important Message to All MoonsDust Holders.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696165948,"id":"16x0usa"}
{"selftext":"**1. Be Ready for Scams:** When you dive into the world of crypto, you'll encounter lots of scams. Watch out for those tempting offers that promise guaranteed returns or fantastic projects. Always be cautious, because if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.\n\n**2. Trust with Caution:** Don't blindly believe influencers, big accounts, or those hyping up specific coins with promises of huge gains. Many of them are paid to promote, so keep your rationality and common sense in check.\n\n**3. Don't Overdo It with Coins:** Many beginners make the mistake of holding too many different altcoins. It can get overwhelming and hard to keep track of. Instead, focus on a handful of solid projects. This way, you can make more thoughtful decisions and save yourself some stress.\n\n**4. Timing the Market is Tricky:** Trying to pick the perfect moment to buy a coin often ends up in disappointment. Prices may never hit your target or might even drop further. A simpler strategy like regularly buying over time can help you navigate this uncertainty.\n\n**5. Speculation Rules the Game:** Cryptocurrency prices often soar because people speculate about their potential value, rather than any real-world utility. When the hype fades, so do potential profits. That's why new projects often perform much better.\n\n ","title":"5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Started with Crypto","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696166487,"id":"16x129m"}

Tokenization can improve capital markets operations such as securities issuance by lowering the costs, speeding up the transactions, and improving the customer satisfaction & not only limited for financial services. It can also transform other sectors: airlines, money transfer & consumer loyalty programs by creating new possibilities and value for customers & businesses. Tokenization is more than just creating digital assets:\n\n\\- The creation of a digital representation of ownership of an existing real-world or natively digital asset\n\n\\- The issuance of units of the asset and the delivery of tokens to the owners' wallets\n\n\\- Lifecycle management of the asset.\n\nIt can revolutionize the way securities are issued & traded by automating key back-office operations and reducing costs and inefficiencies. This can create more opportunities & liquidity for mid-market corporate bonds, which are often overlooked by the big banks or it can also level the playing field for companies that need to raise capital giving them access to more investors with lower interest rates.  Tokenization offer many benefits for different types of assets: faster transactions, improved security & new capabilities. These new properties are quite interesting which create new opportunities & value for assets that were previously limited or inaccessible like stablecoins (digital currencies that are pegged to real-world assets the US dollar or gold), cash transferred and stored digitally without intermediaries or fees, airline tickets to be traded and redeemed on chain without fraud or delays. These can unlock the potential of many assets, create new markets & services. Therefore, financial institutions & enterprises should pay attention this or risk being left behind.\n\n&#x200B;","title":"Tokenize the Future","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696237313,"id":"16xroo7"}

{"selftext":"Thoughts on scammers:\n\nThe benefits or potential profits outweigh the risk of being caught. Most scammers are in lesser developed parts of the world, where smaller scams represent a larger reward. \n\nSocial media is rife with scams of all kinds, not just cryptocurrency related. Every social media has drug dealers, romance scams, fake investment scams, fake job offers, fake payment scams, even outright violent thefts when meeting people in person for marketplace goods or automobiles.\n\nCrypto scamming is particularly effective because many people here are already looking for free crypto, are hunting airdrops or are farming for RCPs. RCPs are technically airdrops anyway, even though you pay with your time. Most of us have already earnt some crypto, its visible on reddit accounts or easily via blockchain explorers, and are set up with wallets connected to the site already. \n\nSolutions:\nBuild a world where scamming is not profitable. If I have a job, a family, healthcare and social prospects, people won't need to scam each other. Deeper societal problems like wealth inequality, the job market, average wage, working conditions, or the various relative weaknesses of banking in native currency make scamming more and more appealing. \n\nEducate yourself and others. These scams are extremely easy to spot once youve been here for a while, but they target newbies deliberately for this purpose. Informing each other, reporting, commenting and posting about it is paramount. Educational articles and warnings can prevent people losing everything.\n\nIf you examine one layer deeper, human beings are emotional, greedy and jealous. It is unaddressable and bleeds through into everything, as long as there is such inequality in societies there will always be comparisons thieving your joy. Expectation leads to disappointment, disappointment leads to anger, and we know where anger leads.\n\nIncreased moderation powers like our distributed moderation where any comment and post can be removed. More and more users earn powers each round.\n\nOverall, its a cat and mouse game. You ban them for one thing, they come back doing something else. You set up automod rules, they watch and figure out ways around it. Its very much like chess or braIlian jiujitsu - there are known attacks, counter attacks, defences and counter defences. But it is an endless battle if both sides are skilled. \n\nStay aware, guilty until proven innocent!\n\nAuthor: u\/LivingFondant1419\n\n[Link](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/16xfwc4\/daily_general_discussion_october_01_2023_utc0\/k34owyx\/)","title":"[DD Nominated Comment] Thoughts on scammers: The benefits or potential profits outweigh the risk of being caught.

{"selftext":"Reason 1: Ethereum is targeting the largest investment opportunity in crypto; bigger, even, than bitcoin (and I love bitcoin).\n\nEthereum is a new global computing platform that could rewire how the entire financial industry and much of the creative world works.\n\nReason 2: Ethereum's value is driven by cash flows. This is different from  most other crypto assets.\n\nThe more people who use the Ethereum network the more revenue the  blockchain generates. This revenue benefits ETH holders through the crypto equivalent of buybacks & dividends.\n\nReason 3: Ethereum has the most applications and developers in crypto. If you're looking for where the next breakthrough crypto application will appear, look in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nReason 4: Ethereum is already being used as a platform by big companies.\n\nExamples: 1) Nike did $200m in digital goods revenue on Ethereum in the past few years; 2) PayPal just launched a new payments solution on Ethereum; 3) Goldman Sachs structured a $100m bond on Ethereum.\n\nReason 5: Ethereum is likely to be the home of real-world assets in the crypto ecosystem.

If you put your head down and think, you may be convinced that this indeed is financial advice. If you close your eyes, it may seem logical to do what is in the article.\n\nEven then - Do Your Own Research! This is not financial advice! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/2jcz8dkbcyrb1.gif\n\n# Okay, the Summary First | TLDR | Wallets Next?\n\nSince the G20 meeting in India, there have been talks of collaboration between countries to cooperate and regulate the crypto space. Here is one of the first articles I wrote.\n\n[Remember the Crypto Paper to be discussed at the G20 Summit in India? | Here is a Snapshot](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/16ev4xy\/remember_the_crypto_paper_to_be_discussed_in_the\/)\n\nWhile the framework under the IMF will take at least till 2025 to come to the fore, work on other areas has started parallelly. ***\\*\\*\\*A Global Database of Crypto Exchanges is in the works in India. This database would also include the details of those exchanges on the dark web. The main aim is to tackle and deal with nefarious actors in the cryptoverse.\\*\\*\\****\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/216lmgnlcyrb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf7cf60127f577796d21e76dae2c4991869af77e\n\nThe database creation will, obviously, need the cooperation of other countries that India will take up through its Ministry of External Affairs. There were other initiatives already in place, like that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) crypto asset reporting framework. All this works toward keeping a close watch on crypto transactions and isolating bad actors.\n\nWill it help the general masses? It should. Only time will tell, though.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7mxnvbbjcyrb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=476089fe9da57a481f4605e28af59b277d10aa40\n\n## Now Everything Other Than TLDR | Crypto Exchanges and Bad Actors\n\nAt the time of writing this article, Coingecko shows that there are 874 crypto exchanges listed on the site. All these exchanges are spread across the world. The need for many exchanges comes from the fact that countries would need their crypto exchange\/s to transact in the local currency. However, not all are legitimate ones. To add to that, there would be many exchanges that are not even listed on Coingecko.\n\nThe main intention of these unlisted exchanges is to remain anonymous and, in all possibility, created by bad actors for nefarious activities in the crypto space. In addition, even regular exchanges become sour apples over some time and redirect customer funds out of the exchange. An example is FTX and how most customer funds were transferred to dubious holding companies and SBF\u2019s parent\u2019s account. All this came to light quite late, but a robust framework monitoring exchanges could have a better chance of stopping a crime before it happens.\n\nThe global crypto exchange database intends to have a closer look at crypto exchanges and crypto transactions. This would include even those on the dark web (or those not on Coingecko). That way, acting swiftly to counter bad actors could be effective.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ioq7ppkncyrb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c66587376798f74d82ce5892c5e2771e90288c5\n\n# Will It Work With Only One Country? | What About the Others?\n\nWhile India is taking the lead in the effort, it is by no means something being done by a country alone. Global cooperation will be the key, and it has already been initiated from the G20 summit of last month. Now, the next activity of creating a global database of crypto exchanges will be initiated.\n\nThe work is in line with other efforts across the globe to bring in crypto transparency. On one end of the spectrum is the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) framework to track crypto transactions, and on the other end is the United States' SEC's infamous attempt at regulating crypto by classifying them as securities.\n\nThe individual attempts by countries will only have a limited effect, with other countries continuing in the crypto space unchecked. So, the global framework would lead to global cooperation and hence a better management of information regarding bad actors in the crypto verse.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/06pbffzocyrb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c473cf7b3721e4b65882d07111388b9409ec2012\n\n# What Does It All Lead To?\n\nThe result would be a combined global framework that, in a way, is in line with the original idea from the G20 summit. And remember, the global framework as envisaged in the G20 is designed by smart brains in IMF and FSB. That should lend some credence to the entire work.\n\nThe Global Exchange Database is in line with the original theme and a good starting point. Imagine having a framework and not knowing where to start the tracking. Isn\u2019t it better to bring the main link used to route all crypto assets? I think it makes sense. And add to that, the list of exchanges that we never knew of and still could route our crypto to bad actors. I think it is a win-win.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mqpgxpzqcyrb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=30c75b53cf65ecf151ce6ca0b248471f1ffcc3bf\n\n# Is This All A Good Thing?\n\nThere remain concerns from the crypto players that this could be an attempt by the government to monitor and track their citizens. But then, the basic premise is that the people in the crypto space intend to hide from the government. That may not be the true case.\n\nTake a look at the other side of the coin. Even today, the main news doing the rounds is hacks on exchanges, wallets, and even Twitter influencers. Not to mention big names like Mark Cuban losing about $800K worth of assets from his crypto wallet. Wouldn\u2019t this warrant a better framework of cooperation between countries to track such hackers and scammers? Wouldn\u2019t, therefore, regulation be a good thing? Food for thought.\n\nI root for such cooperation between countries that despite removing our crypto anonymity, gives us a better chance at safeguarding our hard-earned crypto. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vi7mfzsgcyrb1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e17ce9e63e5ae84829d5fdf68b8ca0583a23bd46\n\n\\*\\*Image Courtesy:\\*\\* The Economic Times, India dated 3rd October 2023\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/pmmsctjecyrb1.gif","title":"Global Database of Crypto Exchanges in the Works | Including Those Operating On The Dark Web | To Tackle Money Laundering and Cryptos Used In Crime","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696323584,"id":"16ymq4p"}

So, User Applications (UAs) will integrate with LayerZero by sending message requests to these Endpoints. There, they will declare an oracle-relayer pair so that their messages can be transported from the source to the destination chain.\n\n- LayerZero and Google Cloud recently announced a partnership. in which Google Cloud will be a new \u201coracle\" option for applications built on LayerZero\u2019s interoperability protocol.\n\n- Launched in March 2022, Stargate Finance was the first application to be deployed by utilised LayerZero\u2019s tech stack. You can bridge your assets between various chains. Has launched its governance token, STG, which led to the creation of the first Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT).\n\n- Stargate Bridge (stargate.finance) and Bungee Exchange (with Stargate chosen as a route) are useful platforms if you are keen to farm the LayerZero airdrop.\n\n- LayerZero labs created the Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard to establish a multichain standard for fungible tokens. This OFT standard is interoperable with ERaC-20s, BEP-20s, fungible tokens on Aptos, and more, so cross-chain communications can take place.\n\n- During its Series B funding round, its valuation was determined at $3 billion, which made it comparable to the fully diluted valuation of many established Layer-1 smart contract networks. \n\n- Altitude is a cross-chain bridge powered by LayerZero. People who are keen to farm a $ZRO airdrop may want to use this bridge to transfer assets between Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and Fantom.\n\n- DeFi enthusiasts will gravitate towards Tapioca, which aims of offer a wide range of DeFi services like borrowing and lending across 17+ EVM and non-EVM chains.\n\nAuthor: u\/cryotosensei\n\n[Link](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/16ybg81\/daily_general_discussion_october_02_2023_utc0\/k39dzc9\/)","title":"[DD Nominated Comment] Happy to share my DYOR notes on LayerZero to whoever wants to farm the airdrop: - LayerZero is a lightweight and omnichain interoperability protocol","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696326681,"id":"16ynjeb"}

This is not financial advice! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/inmk7lev05sb1.gif\n\n# Okay, the Summary First | TLDR | Centralized Exchanges\n\nFor long it was known that the weakest link of the cryptoverse is the crypto exchange because of its centralized nature and exposure to hackers. SBF and FTX took this one step further when the world witnessed that the people running an exchange were no saints and they could be the willful culprits in the scheme of things. Not that SBF was the first, nor will he be the last in a verse devoid of regulation.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5y3ilbxy05sb1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c05d8a11b1621afc169108441d8c4c32c89a8b5\n\nSBF played a dirty game, which in hindsight, appears to have been the plan anyway. There seem to be enough and more instances of the crypto funds being moved to holding companies, political patrons, personal accounts, and even parents\u2019 accounts. The trial which has already started plans to bring out these anomalies which seems to have been a trend with SBF and FTX.\n\nThe trial will witness SBF being charged on seven counts that include securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. SBF\u2019s side is not taking this lightly either. They are planning to annul the presentation of former aides and associates as witnesses. In other words, they want no witness to the wrongdoings to testify against the wrongdoer.\n\nThis trial will be watched closely and certainly will set some standards for crypto exchanges to operate in the real world. Let\u2019s hope that customers end up being the winners.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eniqjv7115sb1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8f43eaf25c945016972f9d2ce7fcecddf06d3cc\n\n## Now Everything Other Than TLDR | The No-Regrets SBF and FTX Mismanagement\n\nSince the time the wrongdoings at FTX came to the fore, the founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) appears to have no regrets for his actions. Such blatant has been his defiant behavior that it makes him border on being a psycho. Bullying potential witnesses, calling names, asking the court to grant him five free days a week from jail time, and no-regrets demeanor are just a few of the episodes that the world witnessed before the trial.\n\nOne other thing that came to the fore is that a centralized exchange is not just the weakest link for easy attacks from scammers and hackers, but also from the exchange operators. While we thought all was fine with FTX (exchange), the owners\/operators had figured out a way to access customer funds from the backend and use it for their benefit.\n\nSBF and FTX were not the first to be caught in such a bad act but certainly one of the most defiant ones. FTX instantly caused investors and traders to remove all their holdings from centralized exchanges and move them to their wallets. The call for using Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) also grew louder during this period. And both wallets and DEXs seemed to be the real solution for Centralized Exchange (CEX. Like FTX) and SBF kind of scenario.\n\nBut the solution is not where it ends. All that was lost has to be recovered and the customers have to be paid back. This trial will be closely watched and the outcome will be awaited with bated breath.\n\nWhat about SBF?\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/utlt9ft415sb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1720ce19fe9027e3647f1cc826daa9046f2055a\n\n# SBF, FTX, and Mockery of Law and Customer Trust\n\nThe trial has had some serious work done by lawyers, professionals, and crypto experts over the past few months. We already know that the lawyers' fee alone stands at $300 million and is only set to increase. Sadly, this goes from the money recovered for paying back to customers. In other words, customers are paying for the lawsuit; the one they never intended to be in.\n\nA closer look reveals how FTX managed to divert funds to holding companies like Alameda Research, political patrons, celebrities (probably the only legit transactions), personal accounts, and even Bankman and Fried\u2019s (father and mother) accounts. This led to the implosion of FTX and Alameda Research nearly a year ago and cut off the customers from being able to get their funds.\n\nIt was estimated that $8 billion in customer funds were frozen and the exchange later attempted to file for bankruptcy. The impunity with which the exchange and its owners expected taxpayers to carry the burden of clear mismanagement is appalling.\n\nIf that was not all, SBF and his behavior only angered the world.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0ybevj8615sb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeb235158a1963e89389dd726037a91205f637af\n\n# SBF and His Threats | Requesting 5 Days Free Time Every Week From Jail\n\nSome of SBF's actions seemed right out of Hollywood and others from a mental asylum. Trying to browbeat potential witnesses (because of which SBF was eventually jailed) to requesting five days of free time from jail, the world saw it all.\n\nFTX, much like any exchange, held customers\u2019 funds from many nationalities. For many, the funds would have been their life savings while for others a good portion of their planned retirement. FTX and SBF trampled upon all those dreams without any regrets. Not surprisingly, the world wants to see him in jail and get the strictest punishment that can be meted out.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ovr0qoo715sb1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=25ddb4a05905cae01ed3c19c8fff73ea22819375\n\n## How Does It Go From Here? | The Six Weeks Trial\n\nWhile many things were spoken about the mismanagement of funds, the political patrons were surprisingly spoken the least about. It\u2019s left to our imagination why that happened, but it seems one class of culprits will go scot-free after all.\n\nWhat should we do now? Right now, wait and watch because this time it\u2019s the real deal. The trial should set an example of what should not happen and hopefully get the wrongdoers to pay.\n\nWill this happen?

{"selftext":"**What is** **~~ENS~~** **DNS?**\n\nTo understand what ENS is, one must first comprehend DNS, with a **D**.\n\nDNS stands for \"Domain Name System\" and is a system that everyone uses every day when using internet services. If DNS were to stop now, we would have a big problem. DNS is a registry that translates IP addresses and associated (sub)services related to a domain name into an address that is easy for humans to read and remember.\n\nSo, DNS bridges the gap between a simple, memorable name and its corresponding complex IP address. DNS can do much more, but let's keep it simple with this example.\n\nThe IP-4 address `142.251.36.46` means nothing to you, and it's hard to remember; the chances of making typos are also high. If you enter this IP address in your web browser, you'll see that you end up at google.com. With `151.101.65.140`, you'll be directed to reddit.com, all because of DNS.\n\nDNS translates an IP address into a name that is easy for people to remember.\n\nThere are approximately 4.3x10^(9) (4.3 billion) available IPv4 addresses, all of which are nearly allocated. Therefore, IPv6 was introduced, creating 3.4x10^(38) addresses, an astronomical number. An example of an IPv6 address is `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`\n\n**Wallet Addresses**\n\nIf you think IP addresses are hard to remember, try recalling a wallet address. Take this ETH address as an example: `0xcd2E72aEBe2A203b84f46DEEC948E6465dB51c75`\n\nTheoretically, there are more wallet addresses than atoms in the entire universe. An unpronounceable number of 2^(160), and we haven't even mentioned addresses in other blockchains, which can be even longer and more complex:\n\n    BTC: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa (The address of the first BTC wallet!)\n    ADA: addr1q8dcsx0p4mjhvapm6e3hf36j98shpwjt6hq32q9x5skc6wyyl9c8ht0apu9lnn0fg7fgt9nqljxvsehfs2tjdsnqnnhypl5ljs\n    XLM: GAHK7EEG2WWHVKDNT4CEQFZGKF2LGDSW2IVM4S5DP42RBW3K6BTODB4A\n    KAS: kaspa:qzacs3vl34sswlmalkwkrc53c0kexrtnjxx3a6mkvs60r0qt7lauglmn08307\n    BCH: bitcoincash:qqeht8vnwag20yv8dvtcrd4ujx09fwxwsqqqw93w88\n\n**What is ENS?**\n\nNow that we know what DNS does, it's a small step to ENS, which stands for \"Ethereum Name Service.\" ENS does nothing different from what DNS did in the previous example with IP addresses.\n\nIt links a readable and easily remembered name to a complex address, in this case, one or more wallet addresses.\n\nENS has a similar purpose to DNS but has a significantly different architecture due to the capabilities (and limitations) that the Ethereum blockchain offers. But like DNS, ENS works with a system of dot-separated hierarchical names: `name.extension` (like google.com, reddit.com etc), where the domain owner has complete control to manage and modify it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mb1zgment6sb1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=84e67d33c3e88ce7e7e7c7843e8ea72c32539069\n\nYou can register an ENS domain, like alice.eth. To this domain, you can then link your wallet address(es). Take this wallet address again: `0xcd2E72aEBe2A203b84f46DEEC948E6465dB51c75`\n\nI could ask you to send crypto to alice.eth, which is much simpler.\n\nAnd instead of telling you to visit my IPFS website via: `https:\/\/ipfs.io\/ipfs\/QmPChd2hVbrJ6bfo3WBcTW4iZnpHm8TEzWkLHmLpXhF68A`\n\nI can also refer you to: `https:\/\/ipfs.ip\/ipfs\/alice.eth`\n\n**Domain Names**\n\nIf you want to use ENS, you can register an available domain. This will be a domain name ending with the .eth or .ens extension and perhaps other will be added in the future (or exist already).\n\nWhether this name is available needs to be checked since these names must be unique. So, if you want a .eth domain, you'll need to be quick or creative. Perhaps marketplaces for these domains will arise in the future like we already have for internet domain names?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ob13a9bpt6sb1.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=d26f29fcee48aaa90114d0a93faa383dd16dcf97\n\nA simple guide on creating a .eth domain with ENS can be found here, but keep reading first!\n\n[https:\/\/medium.com\/the-ethereum-name-service\/step-by-step-guide-to-registering-a-eth-name-on-the-new-ens-registrar-c07d3ab9d6a6](https:\/\/medium.com\/the-ethereum-name-service\/step-by-step-guide-to-registering-a-eth-name-on-the-new-ens-registrar-c07d3ab9d6a6)\n\nIt's also possible to set up an *existing* domain you may already have for use with ENS. Even reddit.com could be used for ENS. This process is a bit more challenging and has some drawbacks. More info about it can be found here:\n\n[https:\/\/medium.com\/@brantly.eth\/step-by-step-guide-to-importing-a-dns-domain-name-to-ens-d2d15feb03e8](https:\/\/medium.com\/@brantly.eth\/step-by-step-guide-to-importing-a-dns-domain-name-to-ens-d2d15feb03e8)\n\n**Use Cases**\n\nFor businesses, the use of ENS is ideal if they don't necessarily want to remain anonymous or don't place a high value on privacy. If companies (would) accept crypto payments, you could scan a QR code using your phone for example.\n\nBut how cool would it be to pay for your coffee via `eth.starbucks.com`? With ENS, this would be a valid wallet address.\n\nDonations could be received at `donatecrypto.wikipedia.org`, or you could buy your new car using the following address `btc-pay.tesla.com`\n\n**Should I Want ENS?**\n\nENS is a cool feature, but it has a downside. And a few major ones as well that are more technical.\n\nUsing ENS for your addresses makes you less anonymous, and many people use (or want to use) crypto for that fact that it is anonymous!\n\nENS addresses are not anonymous; they contain data that can link an address to a person or company, and governments and companies can request this data. So think twice before you use it.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0ymii5sqt6sb1.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc654aaea796d30eda64f51939aa7e28509bc826\n\n**Conslusion**\n\nENS is a convenient tool to simplify crypto transactions and wallet addresses. Similar to DNS for the internet, ENS links readable names to complex addresses, enhancing the user experience. Reduced anonymity is the compromise you have to make when using this service.","title":"ENS (Ethereum Name Service) a simple explanation","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696426173,"id":"16znad0"}

{"selftext":"A couple days ago I posted a poll for what you think the price will be for October. Lots of people were calling for an uptober and ETF futures drew lots of speculation from the market. Raising the price of ETH to around $1730 on Oct. 1st one day before the ETH futures launch. \n\nLaunch day was pretty disappointing. Low trade Volume for the ETF futures caused the price of ETH to fall gradually since then to it's current $1633 which is below the $1650 support that it has been struggling to keep. Not the greatest sign but if ETH can maintain above $1570 that will be a positive sign for the price. Maintaining a crab at it's current level is better than a drop below $1570.\n\nThe month has just started but it is still possible we can see some upward price movement even if only briefly. Without momentum from the ETFs I think a more modest pump is the best we can hope for. Making a run to $1800 with a fall back to crab at current levels doesn't seem out of the question for ETH price. At the very least another small pump to $1730.\n\nOnly time will tell. But all we can see how obvious it is that we are in a deep bear. The speculation from the ETF futures hype barely made a sound. Maybe spot ETFs will awaken something.\n\n#Poll results:\n\n640 votes were casted which is a pretty healthy turn out.\n \nThe results were:\n\n103 votes for $1600s.\nYou all are immune to fomo. Not your first rodeo.\n\n76 votes for $1700s. \nMore realistic traders here.\n\n96 votes for $1800s.\n\n116 votes for $2000.\nThese 2 categories are what i think we would have ran up to had the ETF been launched in a bull market.\n\n205 votes for $2500.\nThis was a bit hopeful but you all have the right spirit. Soon.\n\nStay tuned for more price predictions and analysis.\n\nPeace.","title":"ETH price prediction poll results\/analysis","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696434951,"id":"16zqwrf"}

{"selftext":"Africa is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the world, according to Chainalysis, but remains the smallest, with crypto transactions peaking at $20 billion per month in mid-2021. Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa have the highest number of users in the region.\n\nOut of these millions of users, relatively few of them are actually trading most use crypto to transfer money and accept Online\/International payments. I\u2019m Nigerian and in Nigeria, a basic service like Paypal is banned, and when people want to accept money for freelance work they do, they are faced with a major problem of how to accept direct payments from their clients. That\u2019s where stablecoins come in!\n\nThey receive $100 in USDT, which is instant, and get a middleman to convert it to their native currency, in my case Naira.\n\nSpeaking to my African friends USDT is the preferred transfer currency followed by BTC and ETH.  \nThere's Huge growth in tech workers (developers, designers, Writers, etc.) from Nigeria and Africa in general bet you've also noticed this.\n\n**The Problem they face with Crypto transfers**\n\n**Gas Fees**\n\nA $20 gas fee might be nothing to an American but $20 is thousands in their native currency so they are always looking for a lower gas fee alternative.\n\nThe high gas fees have led to an increased interest in layer 2 solutions and other blockchains where transactions are cheaper and faster. Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, and Cardano are gaining popularity for these reasons.\n\nRegulation remains a significant hurdle. Governments are cautious, and in some cases, outright hostile towards crypto. In Nigeria, for instance, the Central Bank has placed restrictions on crypto transactions, forcing users to rely on peer-to-peer networks. However, this has not dampened the spirit of crypto enthusiasts. They continue to advocate for favorable regulations, educating the masses and the authorities on the potential benefits of embracing crypto.\n\n**Potential Ways to Profit(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE)**\n\n**Investing in Layer 2 Chains**\n\nIn the context of Africa, where high gas fees are a significant barrier, investing in Layer 2 (L2) chains presents a viable solution and profit opportunity. L2 chains offer low transaction fees and enhanced scalability, directly addressing affordability.\n\nLogical Reasons:\n\n* **Affordability:** For Africans, the reduced transaction costs mean more accessibility to the crypto space, driving the adoption and value of L2 chains.\n* **Scalability:** With the ability to process a higher volume of transactions, L2 chains can accommodate the growing African user base without escalating costs.\n* **Innovation:** As these technologies evolve, early investments in L2 chains could yield significant returns, especially in regions where cost-effective transactions are highly sought after.","title":"Real Web3 Use Case: How Africans are using Crypto for payment and transfers Regularly","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1696443050,"id":"16zuavr"}

{"selftext":"EthTrader Contrib model on tokenizing feedback on online marketplaces.\n\nThe tokenized karma and governance system here in EthTrader is a new and unique usecase for cryptocurrency. It has proven that this system can work at scale and provide a brand new model for any internet forum to adopt a similar karma or governance system with a Contrib style token. Even if they don't also distribute a cyptocurrency as well.\n\nThe EthTrader model can be applied in novel ways, outside a Reddit Ethereum subreddit - it could be applied as a feedback system for online selling platforms similar to Amazon, Etsy or eBay, as well as for digital goods or NFTs.\n\n- Sellers get higher feedback scores for posting quickly, packaging securely, offering fair prices. The score is arbitrary, but say 10 points for a perfect sale and less if something goes slowly\/badly. By comparison most marketplaces treat each piece of feedback as one point towards a seller score.\n\n- Buyers get higher scores for each transaction if they pay promptly or leave a feedback message upon receipt of the item. Buyers with low score count for less when they leave positige or negative feedback, and high value buyers' feedback counts for way more. \n\n- Buyers with a high feedback score could unlock additional features, like powers to report sellers for poor listing practices, or to be able to dispute negative feedback.\n\n- The feedback score would be untradeable (soulbound) can't buy swap or sell, distributed by the marketplace automatically once buyers confirm receipt, or even automated further by giving feedback tokens the moment the tracking code changes to received. \n\n- A marketplace could also distribute a cryptocurrency this way, rewarding positive transactions as a buyer or a seller with small amounts of crypto. In exatly the same way we upvote each other here for high quality content with upvotes, positive feedback from a sale or purchase would be the upvote signal. \n\n- A tipping feature could also be added, to tip sellers for exceptional service, or for upgrading to express shipping. \n\n- Multiple benefits of using blockchain technology to automate feedback systems too numerous to do justice to, ease of setup and use, efficiency, timesaving, ultimately all increasing profitability and lack of essential ongoing paid personpower.\n\nI think although not perfect, this could provide a novel new use case for crypto - a way to deal with a feedback system on online marketplaces, all thanks to EthTrader and the blockchain, by using business transactions as signals instead of upvotes. It can be automated and decentralized to a high degree.\n\nThoughts? Does anyone else do anything similar?

{"selftext":"The blockchain trilemma proposes that developers must sacrifice either decentralization, security or scalability as a trade-off to accommodate the other two.  The term is said to be coined by Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, the first chain to solve (or at least work within the constraints) of the trilemma. \n\nEthereum has always had a firm grasp on decentralization thanks initially to Proof-Of-Work validation (and later moving to PoS).   It is also the most secure and decentralized smart-contract platform in existence. The portion of the trilemma Ethereum has battled most with is scalability.  Initially, Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) were the backbone of the network, allowing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to run on a single global computer. However, as Ethereum gained popularity, the EVM's limitations became apparent, leading to slow transaction processing times and high fees.\n\nThis lead to the formation of EVM sidechains.   A sidechain is a separate blockchain that runs independent of Ethereum and is connected to Ethereum mainnet by a two-way bridge.  Using a sidechain involves trade-offs, though, as they trade off some measure of decentralization and trustlesness for scalability.  Sidechains also use separate consensus mechanisms and don't benefit from Ethereum's security guarantees.  Gnosis (the mainnet for Donuts) is an example of a sidechain.\n\nTo address these challenges, Ethereum has undergone a series of upgrades. The first was the creation of \"Layer 2\", or L2, solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups. L2s enable off-chain scaling by processing transactions outside the Ethereum mainnet, significantly reducing congestion and lowering transaction costs. These transactions are then written back to Etereum mainnet by means of a rollup transaction, where 1 transaction on mainnet represents a ledger of many transactions performed on the L2.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum's roadmap includes the implementation of sharding (EIP-4844), a process that involves dividing the network into smaller, interconnected chains or \"shards\". Sharding aims to parallelize transaction processing, vastly increasing the network's capacity and enabling Ethereum to handle a significantly higher number of transactions per second.

{"selftext":"This is going to be a long post (not reflecting my opinion but reflecting what was included in the paper) \n\nFor those who get bored easily, TDLR first:\n\n* `The paper discusses the risks and benefits of crypto assets,` \n* `Proposes a macrofinancial framework to integrate crypto risks into regulatory and systemic risk assessment frameworks,` \n* `Applies the framework to several country cases.` \n* `The authors emphasize the need for policymakers and regulators to take a coordinated and comprehensive approach to addressing the risks and challenges posed by crypto assets, including the potential macrofinancial risks.`\n\n**So according to the IMF paper, what are Macrofinaical risks from Crypto assets?**  \nCrypto assets could potentially pose several macrofinancial risks, including:  \n\n1. **Systemic risk:** Crypto assets could amplify any turmoil in the crypto world into systemic risk, which could have spillover effects on the broader financial system and the economy.  \n\n2. **Mispricing risk:** Crypto assets are highly volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations, which could lead to mispricing and market distortions.  \n\n3. **Transparency risk:** There is a lack of transparency about the underlying value and transactions of crypto assets, which could make it difficult to assess their true risk and value.  \n\n4. **Operational risk:** Crypto assets are subject to operational risks, such as hacking, fraud, and cyber attacks, which could lead to significant losses for investors and market participants.  \n\n5. **Legal and regulatory risk:** The legal and regulatory framework for crypto assets is still evolving, which could create uncertainty and legal and regulatory risks for investors and market participants.  \n\n6. **Liquidity risk:** Crypto assets are subject to liquidity risk, as they may not be easily convertible into cash or other assets in times of stress.  \n\n7. **Reputation risk:** The reputation of the crypto industry could be damaged by incidents of fraud, hacking, or other negative events, which could lead to a loss of confidence in the industry and its products.  \n\nOverall, the paper emphasizes the need for policymakers and regulators to take a coordinated and comprehensive approach to addressing the risks and challenges posed by crypto assets, including the potential macrofinancial risks.\n\n**Linkages between the crypto ecosystem and the traditional financial sector:**\n\nThe below diagram illustrates the various agents involved in the crypto ecosystem, including crypto exchanges, wallets, miners, and DeFi platforms, as well as the traditional financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks, central banks, and payment systems.   \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qbe6u9j2fesb1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=061bc40a9eae4e69cbd55cd47751b9c291909534\n\nThe diagram highlights the potential interconnections and dependencies between the crypto ecosystem and the traditional financial sector, with savers\/investors and borrowers having access to both traditional financial intermediaries and crypto platforms. \n\nThe diagram also shows that crypto players are dependent on traditional financial institutions for custodial services, storage of funds, liquidity provision, and funding.   \n\nOverall, the diagram provides a visual representation of the complex and evolving linkages between the crypto ecosystem and the traditional financial sector, highlighting the need for policymakers and regulators to take a coordinated and comprehensive approach to addressing the risks and challenges posed by crypto assets.\n\n**The distinctive features brought on by crypto assets to the proposed framework:** \n\nThese features include new business models and forms of financial intermediation, financial instruments, markets, and infrastructures, creating a parallel alternative financial system. \n\nCrypto assets also have a decentralized market and governance structure, and they constitute a new parallel financial system that includes many of its key elements. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5vcukcs1gesb1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f2d2183d3dce4cab9505a8290d8c67645c151e2\n\nThe paper also notes that crypto assets have a very fast market response due to automated execution of transactions leading to high price volatility and financial instability, which could also generate unexpected fiscal risks.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of appropriate data for supervision and regulation, rapidly evolving legal and regulatory framework, and highly dynamic and innovative market environment are some of the challenges associated with monitoring and supervising crypto assets.\n\n**What role can policymakers play in addressing systemic risks from crypto assets, and what are some potential policy solutions?**\n\nThe paper suggests that policymakers can play a crucial role in addressing systemic risks from crypto assets by developing and implementing effective policies and regulations. \n\nThe paper proposes a nine-element framework with a firm foundation to operationalize crypto asset policies, which includes monitoring the impact of crypto assets on the stability of the global financial system.   \n\nThe Nine elements:  \n\n1. Main actors in the crypto ecosystem \n\n2. Macro\/micro risks of cryptos \n\n3. Sectoral linkages \n\n4. Transmission channels \n\n5. Indicators 6. \n\nEarly warning systems \n\n7. Stress testing \n\n8. Policy tools \n\n9. Governance  \n\nThese elements are designed to capture the unique features and risks associated with crypto assets and to help policymakers and regulators better understand and manage the potential spillovers to the rest of the financial sector and the economy.\n\nAt the microprudential level, lender-based measures including minimum capital regulatory, or liquidity ratios may need to be redefined or imposed on crypto assets to ensure proper management of risks. \n\nAt the macroprudential level, borrower-based measures, such as debt service to income limits or loan to value ratios, or access rules to emergency liquidity, may need to be extended.   \n\nThe paper also suggests that additional capital surcharges could be imposed on systemically important DeFi lenders, or certain agents playing a key operational role in the validation, exchange or custody of crypto assets could be declared as systemically important and impose special regulations and oversight on them.   \n\nOverall, the paper emphasizes the importance of a coordinated and comprehensive approach to addressing systemic risks from crypto assets, involving international cooperation and collaboration among policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders.\n\n**Here are the summary of the key points of the document in bullet points:**  \n\n\\- The paper aims to contribute to the policy and monitoring gap and complement the data and transparency efforts. \n\n\\- The authors propose a nine-element framework with a firm foundation to operationalize crypto asset policies, which includes monitoring the impact of crypto assets on the stability of the global financial system. \n\n\\- The paper highlights the channels through which crypto assets could amplify any turmoil in the crypto world into systemic risk. \n\n\\- The paper identifies areas of risk from a micro-prudential perspective and reflects them in the proposed crypto risk assessment matrix (C-RAM). \n\n\\- The C-RAM consists of three steps starting with a decision tree followed by a country-level risk mapping and a global crypto risk assessment matrix. \n\n\\- The country-level analysis highlights vulnerabilities and risks, analyzes potential triggers leading to systemic risk, and proposes potential policy tools.\n\n\\- The global C-RAM identifies global risks that would be exogenous to countries and have implications for macrofinancial stability. \n\n\\- The paper characterizes the C-RAM framework that operationalizes systemic risk assessment of crypto risks. \n\n\\- The paper applies the framework to several country cases and discusses the policy challenges and implications. \n\n\\- The paper emphasizes the importance of a coordinated and comprehensive approach to addressing systemic risks from crypto assets, involving international cooperation and collaboration among policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders. \n\n\\- The paper suggests that policymakers can play a crucial role in addressing systemic risks from crypto assets by developing and implementing effective policies and regulations. \n\n\\- The paper proposes various measures at the microprudential and macroprudential levels to manage risks associated with crypto assets. \n\n\\- The paper highlights the potential interconnections and dependencies between the crypto ecosystem and the traditional financial sector, with savers\/investors and borrowers having access to both traditional financial intermediaries and crypto platforms. \n\n\\- The paper concludes that the rapid growth of crypto assets and their integration with the traditional financial sector underscores the need for policymakers and regulators to take a coordinated and comprehensive approach to addressing the risks and challenges posed by crypto assets.\n\nSource: [https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/WP\/Issues\/2023\/09\/30\/Assessing-Macrofinancial-Risks-from-Crypto-Assets-539473](https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/WP\/Issues\/2023\/09\/30\/Assessing-Macrofinancial-Risks-from-Crypto-Assets-539473)","title":"IMF paper: Assessing Macrofinancial Risks from Crypto Assets - Discussion\/Thoughts?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696523472,"id":"170mfe3"}

{"selftext":"Hello!\n\nSince there has been a bit of an iflux of new Bronuts on this sub the last few months i thought now might be a good time to make a small guide on how to comment properly in the daily-thread.\n\nSo, first things first:\n\n**What is the daily discussion thread and why is it important?**\n\nThe daily is the holy grail of shitposting. As they would say in MTV Cribs: \"This is were the magic happens!\".  The daily is buzzing with activity all day long and has reached around 5000 comments the past week. 5000! Thats actually humongous numbers!\n\nNow, why is such an important place? Well, you all know that karma is how you earn them sweet, sweet Donuts so in order to do that you have to comment and, now this is the important bit, get upvoted for your comments.\n\nAt this point you might be thinking: \"Aww shoot, how do i get my comments to stand out in a sea of over 5000 comments a day?\". Well, fret not my friend because thats what im going to tell you right here!\n\n**How to get noticed in the daily in a positive way**\n\nIts quite simple actually: just spam overly positive shit! Some examples to follow can be:\n\n* Good morning, fellow bronuts! \ud83c\udf69 Wishing you a day as sweet and satisfying as your favorite donut. Let's conquer this day together with positivity and a sprinkle of joy! \ud83c\udf1e\u2728 \n* We are so lucky to discover Donuts at 3 million marketcap \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf69\ud83c\udf69\ud83c\udf69\ud83c\udf69 \n* Someone should open a donut shop which accepts donuts as currency. Hope they would not name their employees bronut. \n* Accumulation is a gradual process.\n* Stay strong and HODL and DCA!\n* When Donuts hitting $1 and what will you do then?\n\nSo, as you can see, positive sentiment pays off. You'll also gain bonuspoints if you mention things like ***Bronut, Kraken, DCA, HODL, SBF going to jail, Price of Donuts going up, FIAT being a scam etc****.* Simple stuff really, and there is loads of inspiration to be had from other Bronuts!\n\nYou can also post informative stuff about tech and trading-tips but no-one bothers reading that stuff so its easier to just be insanely positive!\n\n**I got downvoted! Why did that happen?**\n\nWell, you just had to do it, didnt you? Ask questions about governance or suspicious activity in the sub or something else that the majority decided is overly negative. \n\nThis is something you should avoid at all costs. No-one wants to be around pesky people that questions stuff. My advice is to just avoid that all together and spread the positive vibes instead, Bronut! \n\n**Is there anything else to do in the sub except commenting and interacting with the daily discussion thread?**\n\nNo\n\n&#x200B;","title":"Do you want them Donuts in your wall.eth?

{"selftext":"# Ethereum Analysis Update - October 6, 2023\n\n## Overview:\n\nAs of the latest update, Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,634, experiencing a minor dip of 0.43% in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization stands at $196.53 billion USD as the second most popular cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum's 24-hour trading volume is at $5.66 billion USD, reflecting ongoing market activity.\n\n## Recent Price Changes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Price Change (1h): Ethereum has seen a minor increase of 0.3% in the past hour.\n* Price Change (24h): Over the last 24 hours, Ethereum has experienced a marginal decrease of 0.43%.\n* Price Change (7d): Ethereum has witnessed a 2.46% decline in the past week.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0l6nh4w2klsb1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd5d892217b60f7e7351d0e8448b7870e8f69eb\n\n# Technical Analysis:\n\n## Daily Chart Analysis:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ethereum recently underwent an extended consolidation phase near the crucial support level of $1.6K. The price surged towards the 100 and 200-day moving averages, located around $1,765 and $1,805, respectively.\n* These moving averages now serve as dynamic solid resistance levels, a shift from their prior role as support levels. A rejection in this range may signal a valid pullback, potentially leading to another decline towards the $1.6K support level.\n* On the other hand, a successful push above this crucial region could revitalize bullish sentiment, potentially paving the way for further market appreciation.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c0cvs5qtklsb1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a6cc49c8010727b7b1df37a9c63f8af213ea5d9\n\n## 4-Hour Chart Analysis:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The 4-hour chart showcases a positive outlook among Ethereum traders, indicating a potential bullish reversal. After consolidating near the $1.6K support region, Ethereum formed a descending wedge pattern, a bullish reversal pattern, and subsequently broke above its upper threshold.\n* However, Ethereum is approaching an important resistance zone at $1.8K, posing a potential impediment to the current upward rally due to intensified selling pressure.\n* Breaking past this critical range would be favorable for Ethereum buyers and could lead to a surge towards the $2K resistance level. Traders are advised to closely monitor these significant levels to make informed market decisions.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/43hgpuwqklsb1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaa04a304c87b4599a88d03cc28e392bd70552ea\n\n \n\n## Summary:\n\n* Ethereum's price is a bit lower now, and it's facing some tough spots to break through.\n* In the short term, it might go up, but there are challenges ahead. Be careful with your decisions because the market can change quickly.","title":"Is Ethereum About to Hit $2,000?

{"selftext":"So the final scores have been calculated for DONUTS, and MOONs have also been distributed. Perfect time for this post then. As per the title of the post, **let's crack on**!\n\n\\* Figures are calculated using current Moon price of **22.4 cents** and Donut of **1.52 cents.** \n\n\\* Also IMPORTANT note that DONUT supply is exactly **2x** more than Moons, so at the same market cap DONUT should be worth half of Moons (i.e **$1 Moons = 50 cent Donuts**)\n\n*1) Show me the money - comparing top earners in* ***fiat!***\n\nMoon: So the top earners gained 6,040 Moons, in fact there were **6** of them: worth **$1353** even at the Moon dip. Not bad!\n\nSo our Donut King for this round, u\/Kirtash93 \\- he earned a sweet **43939** Donuts - wow! :This is worth **$668, or** almost exactly **half of the top Moon earner.**\n\n*\\*Considering Moon price is* ***15x*** *higher than Donuts, kirtash earning* ***half the fiat value*** *of the top moon farmer in Donuts is* ***mightily impressive****!*\n\nWhat about the more realistic gauge, the number 6 Donut earner (matching the last maxer?): Number 6 earned **22505** Donuts, which is worth **$352 - 1\/4 of the top Moon earner,** which is still not bad as I pointed out above.\n\n*2) Squeaky Bum time!* ***What if market cap of Moon = Market cap of Donut?***\n\nThis one is easy, let me explain for thos who don't get it at first glance.\n\nSupply of Donut is 2x of Moons (i.e **$1 Moons = 50 cent Donuts**).\n\n**At the same market cap**: top user earning **44k Donuts equals earning 22k Moons** per round - this is **4 times the number of Moons** the top r\/cc user earned last round\n\nNumber 6 user earned **22k Donuts = 11k Moons: Roughly 2x the Moon max number.**\n\nTo give a *very rough gauge*, if Donut hit the market cap as Moons one day - then we would be **'earning' \\~3x more** in terms of **distribution ratio** today.\n\n*3) Total number of qualifying users:*\n\n**6190** users qualified for Moon distribution last round.\n\nAround **670** users qualified for Donut distribution last round (increase of around 100 from the previous round).\n\nDespite the increase in users, there are still **9x** more Moon earners than Donut earners. Which is actually very bullish since it shows if you are reading this, you are an **early adopter**!\n\n*4) Concluding thoughts*\n\nThese are just my personal opinions, summarised from my findings above:\n\n\\- Yes, it is **true** that in terms of **fiat**, it does pay more to be a 'Moon farmer' right now. Quick look at the top earner stats show that they earn about 2-4x more than the top 'Donut earner'\n\n\\- However, imo the above point is **very short sighted** because Moon price is **15x** higher than Donut. \n\n\\- I actually think it's incredible that u\/Kirtash93 managed to get half the value of price of the top Moon farmer. He managed to **'outdo'** the top moon farmer by **4x** after accounting for supply differences and also market cap.\n\n\\- Whether you think there's more 'value' in Moons or Donut 'farming' depends on whether you take **current value**, or **future value.** The **ratio for Donut** earning is **significantly higher,** but the **current fiat value** of **Moons** is **significantly higher**\n\n\\- If you don't believe Donut can reach anywhere close to the similar heights than Moons one day, you might be an unhappy camper here and be jealous of Moons. However, I see it in another way - DONUT will catch up someday, and I'm banking on the **future value** of Donuts which will mean the h**igher ratio** will pay off one day. So I will **DDHH** and hope for **BAGMI** one day \ud83d\ude80\n\nWhat do you guys think? I would love to hear from my BroNuts opinion on Moon vs Donut earnings.

{"selftext":"The integration of Web3 technologies in electoral processes is not a futuristic concept but a present-day reality. Blockchain, a core component of Web3, is enhancing electoral transparency, security, and integrity in various countries.\n\nImagine a world where every vote is not just counted, but also trusted. Where transparency isn\u2019t a lofty ideal, but a tangible, touchable reality. That\u2019s the world Web3 is crafting and some countries have already started using it with success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Sierra Leone Leads the Way\n\nIn the March 7 elections in Sierra Leone, 70% of the votes were recorded on a blockchain, marking a significant milestone in the integration of technology in electoral processes. This innovative approach, developed by Leonardo Gammar of Agora, involved anonymously storing votes on an immutable ledger, ensuring instant access to election results and enhancing transparency.\n\nSierra Leone became one of the first countries to implement blockchain in elections. The country utilized blockchain technology to verify the results of the presidential election, marking a significant milestone in the integration of Web3 in governance.\n\nAlthough not a complete voting record, this implementation in a country of 7.4 million people like Sierra Leone is a significant step towards eliminating paper ballots, reducing voting costs, and minimizing corruption.\n\n[**Read More**](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/14\/sierra-leone-just-ran-the-first-blockchain-based-election\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### America Embraces Blockchain-Based Voting\n\nWest Virginia has positioned itself as a pioneer in integrating blockchain technology into the electoral process, marking a significant stride towards modernizing and securing voting systems. In previous elections, the state successfully executed a pilot project that enabled overseas military personnel and other residents to cast their votes securely via a mobile device. Utilizing the blockchain-based platform developed by Voatz, voters could authenticate their identities through advanced biometric verification methods and cast their votes from any location around the globe. The initiative not only enhanced the security and integrity of the voting process but also addressed the challenges of accessibility, ensuring that every eligible voter could exercise their democratic right with ease and confidence.\n\nLooking ahead, the potential expansion of blockchain technology in West Virginia\u2019s electoral process is promising. The initial success of the pilot project underscores the viability of blockchain as a tool for ensuring the security, transparency, and integrity of elections. As the state contemplates broader implementation, blockchain could become instrumental in eliminating common electoral challenges, including voter fraud and manipulation.\n\n[**First successful use**](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2018\/11\/06\/west-virginians-countries-have-voted-by-mobile-device-biggest-blockchain-based-voting-test-ever\/)\n\n[**Future Use**](https:\/\/www.ccn.com\/west-virginia-first-state-to-implement-secure-military-mobile-voting-solution\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Russia\u2019s Experiment with Blockchain Voting, kinda went well??\n\nRussia conducted its largest blockchain-based voting experiment from June 25 to July 1 to decide on constitutional amendments. The e-voting, facilitated by Bitfury\u2019s Exonum blockchain platform, aimed to ensure security and transparency. However, controversies arose with over 20 million \"abnormal\" votes record\n\nDespite the use of blockchain, transparency issues persisted. The electoral commission did not release the vote decryption key, and there was no information on registering a node to observe the voting process. The final count showed a significant majority supporting the amendments, but the controversies surrounding the e-voting process raised questions about the effectiveness and integrity of using blockchain in such a large-scale political event\n\nHere it\u2019s more of humans just deciding not to be transparent since the keys were not disclosed but still an interesting use.\n\n[**Read More**](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/transparency-of-russias-blockchain-voting-setup-put-under-a-microscope)\n\nThese real-world applications underscore the transformative potential of Web3 in redefining electoral processes globally. By ensuring, transparency and security, blockchain technology is poised to address longstanding challenges associated with elections.

{"selftext":"Well, that's something that Susannah Evans, a product lead behind the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol at the Interchain Foundation, told Decrypt that Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 ecosystem \u201cfragments user and liquidity,\u201d referring to the separation of liquidity pools across various networks with no solution for interoperability.  \n\n\nI will quote the article, that said that according to her, the Cosmos ecosystem has advantages over the Ethereum counterpart as all Cosmos-based application chains are \u201cnatively interoperable over IBC.\u201d  \n\n\nWhat do you think? I dunno what to say since I was never a huge fan of Cosmos, there's not any special reason, but probably I didn't pay so much attention to Cosmos, that's why I would love to hear your opinion.  \n\n\nI think that blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin do not guarantee that all nodes will always agree on the same blocks after transaction confirmation, but they guarantee that the probability of agreement is very high. There are blockchains such as Neurochain that I started to explore, which has a new consensus based on the thermodynamics of the network to score the nodes. The consensus presents a very low latency and a high level of accuracy.  \n\n\nStill, there are projects like Cronos, Kava, Osmosis, Canto, Thorchain, Secret Network, and Sei that have been built using Cosmos SDK, but they all still face a much different dilemma: low liquidity.  \n\n\nSo, lack of liquidity adversely affects the efficiency and functionality of DeFi applications in the Cosmos ecosystem, restricting growth and adoption. In that case, my vote goes to Ethereum.  \n\n\nHow about you?

Tokens spent in this process will be burned, contributing to the overall scarcity and value of the tokens.\n\n**Details:**\n\n**Governance Threshold:**\n\nUsers must have a governance score exceeding 20,000 to be eligible for this privilege.\n\n**Posting Cost for Eligible Users:**\n\nEligible users can pay 150 donuts to post without the regular 250 donuts pay2post cost.\n\nThis privilege is limited to three times per round for each eligible user.\n\n**Token Burning Mechanism:**\n\nTokens spent by eligible users for posting (150 donuts per post) will be permanently burned.\n\nThis contributes to the reduction of overall token supply, increasing the value and rarity of the remaining tokens.\n\n**Proposal Approval:**\n\nThe community will vote on the introduction of this governance-backed posting system.\n\nA clear majority must approve the proposal for it to be implemented.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. Encourages active participation and contribution from high-scoring members.\n2. Adds a governance layer, making the community more democratic.\n3. Contributes to token burning, enhancing the scarcity and value of tokens.\n\nWe can discuss the posting cost and whether it should only be for those with governance score exceeding 20,000 or for everyone,\n\nThanks for your time BroNuts.","title":"Proposal: Governance-Backed Posting Privileges","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696684295,"id":"17262mv"}

{"selftext":"**Proposal:** Introducing \"Pay-to-Comment\" System to Combat Spam and Enhance Quality Discourse\n\nHello r\/ethtrader,\n\nWe all have noticed a growing concern within our subreddit regarding excessive spam comments that are adversely affecting the quality of discussions. While we value decentralization, it's essential to address this issue to maintain a high standard of engagement and discourse in our community.\n\nOur moderator u\/carlslarson has previously expressed reservations about limiting posts or the number of comments to uphold the principle of decentralization. In light of this, I propose the implementation of a \"Pay-to-Comment\" system, similar to the successful \"Pay-to-Post\" system we already have in place.\n\n### Proposal Details:\n\n* **Pay-to-Comment Mechanism:** Implement a system where users are required to pay **10 donuts** for each comment they make. This payment will serve as a deterrent to excessive commenting and spam.\n* **Objective:** The primary goal of this proposal is to reduce spam comments while encouraging meaningful contributions from genuine and interested participants in our discussions..\n\n### Benefits:\n\n1. **Reduced Spam:** The introduction of a cost for commenting will discourage users from spamming the subreddit with low-quality or irrelevant comments.\n2. **Encourage Quality Contributions:** Genuine participants who are genuinely interested in the discussion will be more likely to contribute, leading to higher-quality discussions and interactions.\n3. **Sustain Decentralization:** By maintaining the \"Pay-to\" model consistent with our existing system, we uphold the principle of decentralization while addressing the spam issue.\n\nPlease use this thread to discuss the proposed \"Pay-to-Comment\" system, offer suggestions, voice concerns, or present alternative solutions. Let's work together to find a balanced approach that promotes both decentralization and quality engagement within our community.\n\nDo you like these ideas? Will they help make our subreddit better?\n\n\\[YES\\]\n\n\\[NO\\]\n\nYour input and feedback on this proposal are vital for shaping the future of our subreddit.\n\nThank you for being a part of r\/ethtrader and for actively contributing to this discussion.\n\n&#x200B;","title":"[Governance Poll Proposal\/Discussion] Encouraging Quality Contributions: The \"Pay-to-Comment\" Solution","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696690043,"id":"17283lk"}

{"selftext":"According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has gained around 35% in 2023 but has faced strong bearish rejections multiple times when attempting to break above the $2,000 psychological resistance level. There are three likely reasons for Ethereum's failure to decisively retake $2,000 since May 2022.\n\nFirstly, Ethereum's inability to cross above $2,000 in 2023 resembles the bearish rejection near $425 in 2018-2019. In both cases, Ether appears to be in a recovery phase while eying close above its 0.236 Fib line of the Fibonacci retracement graph. In 2023, the same line is near $2,000, enforcing itself again as a selling area and pressuring ETH's price lower.\n\nSecondly, a strengthening U.S. dollar has dampened demand for Ethereum in recent months, reducing its ability to close decisively above $2,000. The prevailing negative correlation between top cryptocurrencies and the dollar has been the main culprit. In 2023, the weekly correlation coefficient between Ether and the U.S. dollar index (DXY) has been consistently negative. Meanwhile, Ethereum has largely underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 due to the ongoing spot Bitcoin ETF hype. The net capital held by Ethereum-tied investment funds has dropped by $114 million so far in 2023, while Bitcoin-based funds have attracted $168 million in the same period.\n\nLastly, the total-value-locked (TVL) across the Ethereum ecosystem has dropped from 18.41 million ETH to 12.79 million ETH so far in 2023, underscoring a reduced availability of funds and resulting in lower yields for investors. The declining TVL has accompanied a drop in the Ethereum network's gas fees, which reached a yearly low on Oct. 5. Ethereum's NFT volumes and unique active wallets have also dropped by 30% and 16.5% in the last 30 days, according to Dapp Radar.","title":"Why Ethereum Struggles to Break Above $2,000: Three Key Factors - by Cointelegraph","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696696284,"id":"172agdb"}

{"selftext":" All,\n\nWhile we all have been through war with inflationary prices, it appears we are coming out the other side. I will preface this with saying this is US focused, and that disinflation is not deflation. Disinflation is simply the slowing of inflationary pressure. And we've been riding that train for the past year and will continue to see it and potentially even some minor deflation. Why do I think so? Have a look:\n\n[ Median, Trimmed, Headline, and Core CPI ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4y3f0h499tsb1.jpg?width=763&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ff90aafec2ab6752bbe746ce765b268d2392d5e)\n\n First up is CPI. We've been trending down over the last while due to falling energy prices apart from the last 2 months which saw an uptick. The remaining measurements, which put less weight on or exclude highly volatile items such as energy have finally started rolling over this year. I expect this trend to continue. I also expect the energy component of Headline CPI to come back down? Why...well, look at the recent trends in gasoline futures and oil pricing over the last little bit. Personal anecdote, I've seen gasoline in my vicinity go from roughly $3.40 USD per gallon at the recent peak to about $3.05-3.07. These will start showing after the September report. \n\n[Oil Prices](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3ij3ac4c9tsb1.jpg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb8c8e015ae0fb0bfbb8cfc67795701343fa70df)\n\n[Gas Futures](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hzq2putd9tsb1.jpg?width=1208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fe90f2bcac276adbc73ceca1eb20ac08ad4771f)\n\n Next key component is food. Now, while there are some specific items that may be heading up a lot, as a broad category they are down. We can look at the Food Price Index, which measures some of the largest commodities components of food. With the exception of sugar, we are either back in normal ranges or net down. The index itself is lower than it was in 2021. \n\n[Food Price Index](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mci7nc1g9tsb1.jpg?width=763&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=862482ac5b35012fcbce16252334929e103f960d)\n\nWhat about housing? Also returned to normal growth rates if not flat over the last year. Interesting note is that the Fed uses a survey that leans on older data to calculate the housing portion of CPI. We haven't REALLY seen that flatten or turn over yet in their metrics.\n\n[Home Prices](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k28pd52j9tsb1.jpg?width=935&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cfa5a10ca14332822883d58d0314971e4b08d16)\n\nWhat about rent growth? Also plummeting.\n\n[Rent Growth](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gi6qtzniatsb1.jpg?width=763&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ac75717694671f5100b88be8e4a477d10b17743)\n\n But what about the BRRRR machine? Well, not worried at the moment. The Fed Balance Sheet is down about a trillion dollars (11% or so) from the high. M2 supply is down about a trillion (5%) from the high. This is actually the longest sustained decrease and flattening of M2 growth I could find. \n\n[Fed Balance Sheet](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/re1t13ukatsb1.jpg?width=1645&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3c6cb5a1eda08fa0ff9335c434bb0b8ec98ff47)\n\n[M2 Supply](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/paj1rb5matsb1.jpg?width=1628&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7292015a6f4c064dbeafdb31f63ead2e2b42b4d2)\n\n What does that mean for us? Well, inflation coming down means increased odds of a pause to close the year and cuts by mid next year. We might not get a soft landing...but we may land with just some paint chips and a busted wheel rather than missing half the plane. M2 is extra exciting because it tends to lead inflation by about a year. See that bit M2 pump in 2020? Inflation started getting super hot a year later. We are about a year from the M2 peak. I expect plenty of room for CPI to come further down sooner than we think.","title":"Disinflation is Coming.

For the blockchain to be secure and authentic, this concept is crucial.\n\nFinality is attained by the blockchain network\u2019s use of consensus.

{"selftext":"# This is a How to Crypto guide for those who are just starting out.\n\n# 1) Understanding the Basics:\n\n   \n\n* **What is Cryptocurrency?** Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies, most cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology.\n* **What is Blockchain?** A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. It's the technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies.\n\n# 2) Getting Started:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Choose a Wallet:** A cryptocurrency wallet is essential for storing, sending, and receiving crypto. There are various types, including hardware wallets, software wallets, and online wallets. Research and choose one that suits your needs. Lets see difference between Cold Wallets and Hot Wallets.\n\n**Cold Wallet:**\n\n* **Description:** A cold wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet, ensuring enhanced security by reducing exposure to online threats. Cold wallets are considered more secure for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies.\n* **Advantages:**\n\n1. Immune to online hacking attempts.\n2. Ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency.\n\n* **Disadvantages:**\n\n1. Less convenient for frequent transactions.\n2. Initial setup may be more complex.\n\n**Hot Wallet:**\n\n* **Description:**  A hot wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet and is typically used for active trading and everyday transactions. Hot wallets offer convenience but are more vulnerable to online security threats. \n* **Advantages:**\n\n1. Convenient for daily transactions and trading. \n2. User-friendly interfaces. \n\n* **Disadvantages:**\n\n1. More susceptible to hacking and malware. \n2. More susceptible to hacking and malware. \n\nIn essence, the choice between a cold wallet and a hot wallet depends on your specific needs and use cases. Cold wallets are like a digital safe for long-term storage, while hot wallets are like your regular wallet, readily accessible but with higher security risks. Many individuals use a combination of both to balance security and convenience based on their cryptocurrency usage patterns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Select a Cryptocurrency:** Start with well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Learn about their use cases, communities, and potential for investment.\n\n### 3) Buying Cryptocurrency:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Choose a Cryptocurrency Exchange:** Use reputable exchanges to buy crypto. Popular ones include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Create an account, complete the necessary verifications, and link your bank account or credit card.\n* **Place Your First Order:** On the exchange, navigate to the trading section. Choose the cryptocurrency you want to buy, enter the amount, and place your order. You can buy fractions of a coin if needed.\n\n### 4) Security Tips:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhance your account security by enabling 2FA on both your exchange and wallet.\n* **Backup Your Wallet:** Securely store your wallet's backup phrase. This is crucial for recovering your funds if you lose access to your wallet.\n\n### 5) Storing and Managing Your Cryptocurrency:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Use Hardware Wallets for Long-Term Storage:** For significant amounts of cryptocurrency, consider using hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor for added security.\n* **Diversify Your Portfolio:** Explore different cryptocurrencies to diversify your investment. Research and understand each project before investing.\n\n### 6) Learning to Trade:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Understand Market Basics:** Learn about market orders, limit orders, and stop orders. Understand how to read charts and interpret market trends.\n* **Start Small:** If you decide to trade, start with a small amount to minimize risks while you learn.\n\n### 7) Keeping Up with Crypto News:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Follow Reputable Sources:** Stay informed by following reputable crypto news sources. Understand how news can impact the market.\n* **Join Crypto Communities:** Engage with communities on social media platforms or forums. Learn from others, ask questions, and share your experiences.\n\n### 8) Advanced Concepts:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Smart Contracts:** Explore the concept of smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Ethereum is a major platform for smart contracts.\n* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Understand the basics of decentralized finance, which includes lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries.\n* **Staking and Yield Farming:** Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a blockchain network and, in return, earning staking rewards. Yield farming is a DeFi concept where users provide liquidity to decentralized platforms in exchange for rewards. \n* **Cross-Chain Platforms:** Cross-chain platforms aim to connect different blockchain networks, enabling interoperability and the transfer of assets and information across multiple blockchains. Examples include Polkadot and Cosmos. \n\n### 9) Security Measures:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Beware of Scams:** Be cautious of phishing attempts, scams, and fraudulent schemes. Never share your private keys or passwords.\n* **Regularly Update Your Software:** Keep your wallet and exchange software up to date to benefit from the latest security features.\n\n**Pro-Tip: If a hot girl dm's you then it is 100% a scam.**\n\nRemember, the crypto space can be complex, and it's okay to take your time to learn. Always prioritize security and conduct thorough research before making any significant decisions.

{"selftext":"\n*On October 7, 2023, Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, presented a series of solutions to bolster the decentralization of staking pools and protocols on the Ethereum network. These proposals also focused on fortifying the security of these protocols to mitigate potential attacks.*\n\n## Addressing Decentralization Concerns:\n*Buterin's recommendations directly tackle existing challenges within the staking process, particularly the concerns of centralization risk among node operators and the strain on the consensus layer. He highlighted decentralization issues in the current selection process for node operators across various staking pools and identified an overhead in authorizing transactions in the Layer 1 (L1) consensus mechanism. To mitigate these challenges, Buterin advocated for the adoption of a two-tier staking system similar to models used by projects such as Rocketpool and Lido.*\n\n- *Node operators would function as validators, running nodes to create new blocks and committing a specific amount of ETH to the staking pool.*\n- *Delegators would become pool members, staking their assets with their chosen node operators. Delegators would have the autonomy to select their preferred node operators.*\n\n**Tweet by Vitalik Buterin:**\n[*Link to the tweet*](https:\/\/x.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1710533774071787587?s=20)\n\n## Enhancing Staking Pool Security:\n*In addition to addressing centralization concerns, the proposed two-tier system aims to bolster security within staking pools. By enabling Delegators to determine node operators, the system creates a strong barrier against potential attackers. To deter malicious attempts, those aspiring to become node operators without Delegator support would need to commit a substantial portion of their ETH, possibly up to 1\/3 of the total staking, amounting to more than 2.08 million ETH. This high cost significantly discourages hacking attempts.*\n\n## Impact and Implementation:\n*Vitalik Buterin emphasized that implementing these recommendations could alleviate the issues affecting the Ethereum Layer 1 staking protocol. This approach empowers stakers to select their preferred nodes, fostering a more decentralized and consensus-driven system. Moreover, the proposed model significantly reduces the number of required signatures from 800,000 to 10,000, encouraging an increase in node validators and further reinforcing the security and decentralization of the staking process.*","title":"Vitalik Buterin Proposes Decentralized Solutions and Enhanced Security for Ethereum Staking","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696752726,"id":"172tr0u"}

No buy limit, one account can buy N tickets, it\u2019ll increase the chance of being picked but it\u2019ll never be a sure thing\n- all the donuts used for paying the tickets go into a pool\n- 3 winners, that share the pool that way : 1st get 60%, 2nd get 25%, 3rd get 15%. That way, **100% of the donuts will be redistributed**\n- We can decide together the duration of the lottery, I was thinking every 3 days or every week\n\nBecause we need to think about edge cases : \n- if there\u2019s less than 3 players, instead of awarding the donuts, the entry fees will be refunded to the players. There\u2019s no fun if it\u2019s shared between 2 people\n- if there\u2019s strictly less than 7 tickets sold, the entry fees will be refunded to the players : because if there\u2019s less tickets than that, the 3rd winner will get less than the ticket price. Which is weird, you\u2019d be winning the lottery but you\u2019d loose money in the process. \n\nSo we need at least 3 different players and 7 tickets sold for a lottery to be \u00ab\u00a0valid\u00a0\u00bb and to go through \n\nIf we want to burn donuts in the process, we\u2019ll need to decide on a % of the pool, and then the condition for the validity of the lottery might change but I\u2019ll take care of that\n\nAuthor: u\/ToshiSat\n\n[Link](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/172jk3l\/daily_general_discussion_october_07_2023_utc0\/k40qy4k\/)","title":"[DD Nominated Comment] I\u2019m so glad you guys love the idea of a donut lottery !

{"selftext":"There has been a dramatic reduction in spam lately, just the odd post and comment slipping through! \n\nSince I started a daily scam update, the types of scams stopped happening. The fake airdrop scams seem to have almost stopped. There's any number of reasons for that, of course not limited to me experiencing the Baader Meinhof effect or similar. \n\nTotally worth Googling the Baader Meonhof effect, by the way. Brilliantly, you'll start to see it everywhere \ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso a big help by all of the 20k contrib members, its really making a difference. \n\nScammers are watching the daily thread. I have been downvoted mentioning that BinanceDEX post was a scam, in the daily, unrelated to any post. So it could be that they realise we all know about airdrops being fake and are moving on. \n\nAnd finally, pessimism is telling me that we should prepare for new and different types of scams. It's a cat and mouse, jiu jitsu game of counter attack and counter defence with scammers of all kinds. Be prepared for any and all attacks, look up good internet opsec. Ask questions if unsure, dont click any links, never give your seed phrase, ignore all dms however compelling, dont connect your wallet without checking, double check all urls etc.\n\nIf you do come across anything and you aren't quite sure, ask in the daily. Or warn fellow community members if you see anything thats definitely suspicious.\n\nTldr:\n- Scam posts have slowed down. Good.\n- Be extra cautious, as this could mean they are trying to find new or novel ways to scam.

{"selftext":"## Ethereum Price Analysis\n\n- **Current Status**: Ethereum (ETH) is slowly moving lower towards the $1,600 support against the US dollar, and it remains at risk of further losses unless it can clear the key levels at $1,650 and $1,665.\n\n- **Struggle for Support**: Ethereum is facing difficulty in staying above the critical $1,600 support zone and is currently trading below $1,630 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. A connecting bullish trend line with support near $1,620 is forming on the hourly chart of ETH\/USD.\n\n- **Recent Attempts and Declines**: Ethereum made an attempt to gain strength above the $1,650 resistance, but it failed to settle above this level and struggled further to clear $1,665, resulting in underperformance against Bitcoin. A recent high was around $1,664 before the price saw a decline and retested the $1,620 support. A low was formed near $1,617.\n\n- **Current Movement and Recovery Wave**: Ethereum is now attempting another recovery wave after briefly exceeding the $1,625 level. However, it is trading below $1,640 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\n- **Resistance Levels to Watch**: On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,640 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistances are at $1,650, $1,665, and $1,750. A close above the $1,665 resistance might send the price towards the key resistance at $1,750.\n\n- **Potential for an Upward Move**: To initiate a substantial upward movement, Ether needs to settle above the levels of $1,720 and $1,750, with the next key resistance potentially at $1,850. Further gains might pave the way for a push towards $1,920.\n\n- **Possibility of More Losses**: If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,665 resistance, it could continue to move down. The initial support on the downside is near the $1,620 level, followed by the critical support level at $1,600. A downside break below $1,585 might initiate another strong decline, possibly revisiting the $1,540 level and potentially going even lower to $1,500.\n\n## Technical Indicators\n\n- **Hourly MACD**: The MACD for ETH\/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\n- **Hourly RSI**: The RSI for ETH\/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\n---\n\n*Chart Source: [ETHUSD on Binance]*","title":"ETH Price Update: Ethereum Struggles to Defend $1,600 as Bulls Aim for $1,750","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696830691,"id":"173kefw"}

{"selftext":"Hey, fam!\n\nI'm a data engineer and part-time blockchain enthusiast. In the past year, I've been more and more involved in blockchain analysis, trying to find better investment opportunities using my data skills.\n\nI've been connecting to blockchain nodes and collecting various types of data to calculate network metrics and get an unbiased view of the blockchain state and adoption level (you know, blockchain project websites often love to inflate their own metrics).\n\nPersonally, when I assess the quality of a particular blockchain I look into 4 types of metrics:\n\n1. **Technicals.** Support for EVM\/WASM standards. Size of transaction fees (average and peak), throughput measured by TPS and block size, level of decentralization measured by number of active nodes and node requirements.\n2. **Community.** Size of Twitter\/Discord\/Reddit communities of the network together with all projects building on it, quality of posts in these communities, average engagement level. Another important thing is developer activity, which can be measured by Git (e.g. number of commits and pull requests in project-related repos)\n3. **Liquidity.** Liquidity available on-chain measured by TVL, the market cap of stablecoins, the number and quality of DeFi protocols building on chain, size of liquidity in DeFi apps. Also, another aspect is native token liquidity health (ratio between trading volume and total coin market cap). Better liquidity health means that you can sell more tokens without influencing the price.\n4. **Infrastructure.** The available infrastructure needed for dApp projects to build on the chain and for average users to easily interact with the network. This can be measured by the number and quality of wallets, block explorers, node providers, custodians, etc.\n\nI'm curious how other people make a decision about which network to invest. And what are the most interesting metrics, which may be indicators of the rising star?  \n\n\nAlso, which category do you think is the most important for blockchain success?\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/173l499)","title":"Blockchain Investments 101: How To Select a Blockchain?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696833455,"id":"173l499"}

Swiss bank UBS took part in Project Guardian - an initiative led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore - to do a pilot of a tokenized version of its variable capital company (VCC) fund. It used the Ethereum blockchain to do several activities like redemptions and fund subscriptions.\n\n3. DBS, one of Singapore\u2019s leading banks took part in Project Guardian - an initiative led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore - to experiment with the purchase and sale of tokenised versions of Singapore Government Securities, Singapore Dollars, Japanese Government Bonds, and Japanese Yen. These test trades were conducted via an automated market marker (AMM), which leveraged smart contracts to automatically execute buy and sell transactions.\n\n4. Tokenisation is also gaining traction in the real estate industry as it allows high-value properties to be broken down into digital tokens, thus making it cheaper for people wanting to invest in real estate.

{"selftext":"Many of you have heard of the Mask Network and have possibly even traded the token. But what is mask and what can you do with it?\n\nShort answer, Mask Network is a dapp that bridges Web2 (web we use today) and Web3 (web you can [read-write-own](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/web3\/)). I went ahead and went through the easy installation of the dapp and tested it's features!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[You can create a brand new ETH wallet or import your existing EOA wallet \\(rabby, metamask etc..\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cdtcbfsp08tb1.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=3de521e5fc236275a89df3bda8cf64058fa3791d)\n\nThe really big thing other than encrypting your data on social media accounts is creating an identity\/persona that's tied to a web 3 wallet you specify and assign. My understanding of this is if social media companies decide to take down your account or content, or even cease to exist, they can't take down your web3 identity because it's tied to the blockchain wallet of choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The mask dapp \\\\\"dashboard\\\\\" inside your twitter\\\/X profile when you want to interact with features.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lcm8t2os18tb1.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4a12edd95e52655597b6ddb197beb162f959c4e)\n\nOne of the coolest features I noticed right away was the ability to SWAP and check out the security of a token right from this built in \"dashboard\" from the dapp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Token risks warnings and making sure you're sending, trading the correct token!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eurctwcc28tb1.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=723e8c1c0e6ccb0e01e66732f9a39c8ced2cdc97)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5ly1bazh28tb1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=83cc78863dea7362e1db5bfc56d604d0b5eb25f7\n\nReally awesome to see gnosis support alongside mainnet and a few other chains from the start!\n\nAnother really sweet feature that's built into the MASK dapp is a L2-L2 cross-chain bridge.

{"selftext":"TL;DR - The latest ETH sales might be used for financing salaries and assisting developers who work with the Ethereum Foundation. The selling of 3700 ETH has put some pressure on ETH price that's visible. \n\nThe recent sale of 1,700 ETH by the Ethereum Foundation has sparked suspicions about their objectives. Let's take a closer look at their activities and potential causes to shed some light on this.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is critical to comprehend the Ethereum Foundation's financial situation. They currently do not profit from Ethereum, instead burning all base transaction fee earnings. \n\nHowever, according to current on-chain data from Token Terminal, Ethereum lost $10.96 million last month and $9.34 million this month, primarily due to lower network activity, leading in ETH inflation.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation presently has 316.8K ETH in its possession. They've sold about 2,000 ETH in the last three months, with a further 1,700 ETH recently sold from a multisig wallet: 0x23292996e6d30c04a21ca8203dccf88cb418395b, which also holds 1,700 ETH that might be sold.\n\nSo, what is the Foundation's motivation for selling ETH? While the particular reasons are unknown, it is worth mentioning that they dedicated $48 million for research, development, and awards to Ethereum developers in 2021. \n\nThe latest ETH sales might be used for similar purposes, such as financing salaries and assisting developers who work with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThese sales have put selling pressure on the ETH price, resulting in a 3.86% drop today. The crypto community will continue to be interested in following the Foundation's actions as Ethereum's environment evolves.","title":"Potential Reason Behind Ethereum Foundation Selling 1700 ETH Recently - A Brief Analysis","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696878174,"id":"173zzzp"}

Here is a link to the tool:\n\n[https:\/\/dailydefi.org\/tools\/impermanent-loss-calculator\/](https:\/\/dailydefi.org\/tools\/impermanent-loss-calculator\/)\n\nWith this tool, you can experiment on various situations that could happen and how your holdings would be changed.\n\nAs an example:\n\nIf you initially put 500$ of ETH(at initial price 1600) and 500$ of Donuts(at initial price 0.015) in the liquidity pool, this would mean you have put 0.31 ETH and 33,333 Donuts in the liquidity pool.\n\nNow let's say the price of ETH stays at 1600, but for some reason the price of Donuts pumps and end up being worth 0.10 each, in the liquidity pool, you would end up with 0.81 ETH and 12,900 Donuts which means you would have a \\~32% impermanent loss. You would still have made profit, but not as much as if you would have simply held because if you held, you would have 0.31 ETH and 33,333 Donuts which amount to $3,833.33 compared to $2,581.99 if you had provided liquidity.\n\nNow the yearly return for staking your Donuts on the donut dashboard is around 50% which is very good, but the impermanent loss that would happen with a price pump might not be always worth staking, that is your decision to make.\n\nI am glad to understand the risks that come with providing liquidity so that I can make a better informed decision.

These components are responsible for ensuring that the L2 rollup is secure and that transactions are processed correctly.\n\n\\- **Execution Layer**: This layer includes the virtual machine (VM) and the smart contract language that are used to execute transactions on the L2 rollup. The VM is responsible for interpreting and executing smart contracts, while the smart contract language is used to write the contracts themselves.\n\n\\- **Data Availability Layer**: This layer is responsible for ensuring that all data related to the L2 rollup is available to all participants. This includes transaction data, state data, and other metadata that is needed to verify transactions.\n\n\\- **Communication Layer**: This layer is responsible for handling communication between different components of the L2 rollup, as well as between the L2 rollup and the main chain. This includes message passing, event notification, and other forms of communication.\n\n\\- **Application Layer**: This layer includes the user-facing applications that are built on top of the L2 rollup. This includes wallets, dApps, and other tools that allow users to interact with the L2 rollup.Each layer has a specific function and is designed to work together with the other layers to create a secure and scalable L2 rollup.\n\n\\-->> **What are some of the projects running on the OP Stack ecosystem?**\n\nSome notable projects that are using the OP Stack include Base, Zora Network, Public Goods Network, Debank  \n and a few others that are still in the testnet stage.\n\nBase, in particular, has relatively high numbers of cumulative unique addresses, which may be due to its Onchain Summer event and integrations with Coinbase.\n\nThese projects are contributing to the growing OP Stack ecosystem by creating new L2 rollups that use the OP Stack, which helps to expand the network of shared, interoperable, and coordinated sets of L2 blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that these projects are using the OP Stack suggests that it is becoming a more widely adopted and standardized development stack for creating L2s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**-->> The role of Conduit and AltLayer within the OP Stack Infrastructure?**\n\n**What is Conduit?**\n\nConduit is a company that is building a suite of products for the OP Stack. Its primary focus is on the Arbitrum rollup, which is a specific type of L2 rollup that uses optimistic rollup technology.\n\nConduit's first product suite, Arbitrum One, is a fully decentralized and trust-minimized L2 rollup that is designed to be compatible with Ethereum. It is currently in production and has been audited by several third-party security firms.\n\nConduit's second product suite, Arbitrum Orbit, is a set of tools and services that are designed to help developers build and deploy their own L2 rollups on the OP Stack. It includes a no-code dashboard, a set of APIs, and other middleware that can be used to customize and manage L2 rollups.\n\n**What is AltLayer?**\n\nAltLayer is another company that is building products for the OP Stack. Its platform is designed to be a \"rollup-as-a-service\" (RaaS) protocol that allows developers to launch optimistic rollups quickly and easily.\n\nAltLayer's platform is designed for a multi-chain and multi-VM world and thus supports EVM, as well as WASM (used by Cosmos, Polkadot, etc.).\n\nAltLayer also has plans to support the Solana VM (Sealevel) and the Move VM.\n\nAltLayer offers support for multiple different software development platforms, including Arbitrum Orbit, Polygon zkEVM, and others alongside the OP Stack. AltLayer is currently in testnet.\n\n**How do Conduit and AltLayer compare?**\n\nConduit and AltLayer are both companies that are building products for the OP Stack, but they have different focuses and offerings.\n\nConduit's primary focus is on the Arbitrum rollup, and its product suite includes a fully decentralized and trust-minimized L2 rollup (Arbitrum One) as well as a set of tools and services for building and deploying custom L2 rollups (Arbitrum Orbit).\n\nAltLayer, on the other hand, is focused on providing a RaaS protocol that allows developers to launch optimistic rollups quickly and easily.\n\nIts platform is designed to be multi-chain and multi-VM, and it supports multiple different software development platforms, including Arbitrum Orbit, Polygon zkEVM, and others alongside the OP Stack.AltLayer's product offering includes a no-code dashboard that allows developers or even users with limited coding experience to spin up a customized L2 rollup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**-->> What are the different L2 solutions available?**\n\nSome popular L2 solutions include:\n\n\\- **Optimistic rollups**: These are L2 solutions that use optimistic verification to achieve scalability. Optimistic rollups allow transactions to be processed off-chain and then verified on-chain, which can significantly reduce gas costs and increase throughput. Examples of optimistic rollups include Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync.\n\n\\- **ZK rollups**: These are L2 solutions that use zero-knowledge proofs to achieve scalability. ZK rollups allow transactions to be processed off-chain and then verified on-chain using zero-knowledge proofs, which can significantly reduce gas costs and increase throughput. Examples of ZK rollups include zkSync and Loopring.\n\n\\- **Plasma**: This is an L2 solution that uses a hierarchical structure of sidechains to achieve scalability. Plasma allows transactions to be processed off-chain and then periodically committed to the main chain, which can significantly reduce gas costs and increase throughput. Examples of Plasma implementations include OMG Network and Matic Network.\n\n\\- **State channels**: These are L2 solutions that allow users to transact off-chain without requiring a full blockchain consensus. State channels allow users to transact with each other directly and then periodically commit their transactions to the main chain, which can significantly reduce gas costs and increase throughput. Examples of state channel implementations include Raiden Network and Connext.\n\n\\-->> **A summary about OP Stack**\n\n\\- The OP Stack, an open-source software development stack for creating Layer 2 (L2) blockchains on Ethereum.\n\n\\- The OP Stack aims to simplify the creation of L2s, create a network of shared, interoperable, and coordinated sets of L2 blockchains, and provide a standardized, shared, and open-source development stack.\n\n\\- The benefits of using the OP Stack to create L2s, including its ease of use, interoperability, and standardization.\n\n\\- Optimism's vision of a decentralized network of L2s that share security and a communication layer (the Superchain), which differs from other approaches to scaling Ethereum in its focus on standardization and interoperability.\n\n\\- A list of notable projects that are using the OP Stack, including Base, Zora Network, Public Goods Network, and DeBank and notes that these projects are contributing to the growing OP Stack ecosystem by creating new L2 rollups.\n\n&#x200B;","title":"\ud83d\udca5 Details about Optimism OP Stack \ud83d\udca5","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696955611,"id":"174pkog"}

This includes wallets, dApps, and other tools that allow users to interact with the L2 rollup.Each layer has a specific function and is designed to work together with the other layers to create a secure and scalable L2 rollup.\n\n\\-->> **What are some of the projects running on the OP Stack ecosystem?**\n\nSome notable projects that are using the OP Stack include `Base, Zora Network, Public Goods Network, Debank` and a few others that are still in the testnet stage.\n\nBase, in particular, has relatively high numbers of cumulative unique addresses, which may be due to its Onchain Summer event and integrations with Coinbase.\n\nThese projects are contributing to the growing OP Stack ecosystem by creating new L2 rollups that use the OP Stack, which helps to expand the network of shared, interoperable, and coordinated sets of L2 blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that these projects are using the OP Stack suggests that it is becoming a more widely adopted and standardized development stack for creating L2s.\n\n\\-->> **A summary about OP Stack**\n\n\\- The OP Stack, an open-source software development stack for creating Layer 2 (L2) blockchains on Ethereum.\n\n\\- The OP Stack aims to simplify the creation of L2s, create a network of shared, interoperable, and coordinated sets of L2 blockchains, and provide a standardized, shared, and open-source development stack.\n\n\\- The benefits of using the OP Stack to create L2s, including its ease of use, interoperability, and standardization.\n\n\\- Optimism's vision of a decentralized network of L2s that share security and a communication layer (the Superchain), which differs from other approaches to scaling Ethereum in its focus on standardization and interoperability.\n\n\\- A list of notable projects that are using the OP Stack, including Base, Zora Network, Public Goods Network, and DeBank and notes that these projects are contributing to the growing OP Stack ecosystem by creating new L2 rollups.\n\nAuthor: u\/tambaybtc\n\n[Link](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/1747nzx\/daily_general_discussion_october_10_2023_utc0\/k4ahnul\/)","title":"[DD Nominated Comment] u\/aminok Kindly check \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb as promised. \\---------------------------------------------------------- **Optimism OP Stack** \\-->> Introduction Whether","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696955870,"id":"174po8n"}

{"selftext":"Hey EthTraders!\n\nAs we've been trading, discussing, and hodling, there's been a quiet revolution brewing that could reshape the educational landscape globally. And guess what? We're already taking the first steps with donuts.\n\n**The Vision:** Imagine a world where a Large Language Model (LLM), akin to GPT-4, operates on the Ethereum blockchain. This LLM could serve as a 24\/7 private tutor, delivering tailored explanations on virtually any topic. The kicker? It's decentralized, driven by the community, and potentially affordable or even free for all.\n\n**Donuts: The First Step?**\n\n- **Reddit and Donuts:** Our beloved donuts on \/r\/ethtrader are more than just community points. They're a real-world example of how Ethereum can be used to create decentralized systems with community governance. Tying Reddit accounts to donut balances has already created a unique ecosystem where users are rewarded for their contributions.\n\n- **Decentralized Governance:** Just as donuts allow for community-driven decisions, a decentralized LLM could use a similar system. Content quality, updates, and community guidelines could be decided based on a governance model inspired by donuts.\n\n**Why Ethereum?**\n\n1. **Decentralization:** Ethereum ensures that educational resources aren't monopolized by any single entity, fostering unbiased learning.\n\n2. **Trust & Verification:** With Ethereum's ledger, content can be vetted, verified, and updated transparently by the community.\n\n3. **Affordability:** Leveraging Ethereum's ecosystem might allow for community grants, subsidies, or even crowd-funding to make LLM access affordable.\n\n**Challenges and Discussion Points:**\n\n- **Identity Verification:** A robust identity layer is needed to ensure genuine contributors and safe personalization for learners.\n  \n- **Gas Fees and Scalability:** Given Ethereum's current challenges, how can we ensure this system is efficient and cost-effective?\n  \n- **Existing Initiatives:** Are there projects on Ethereum already aiming for a similar goal?\n\nWith donuts, we've already seen the power of decentralized community governance. Can we take this concept further and apply it to education? Let's brainstorm, discuss, and perhaps take the first steps toward making this vision a reality!","title":"From Donuts to Decentralized Education: Ethereum's Potential to Revolutionize Learning","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1696974815,"id":"174xaw4"}

{"selftext":"First of all, sorry for this really long post. I decided to do this post to put some perspective that financial system has always been evolving and that we are probably witnessing this evolution right now.\n\nIt really took me a lot of effort to gather all this information and then gathering together to create a consistent post. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks in advance.\n\n# What is Crypto?\n\nUnderstanding what Crypto is use to be a hard for a lot of people because of its technical nature.. However, talking about Crypto is discussing about the future because as we have seen until now, this is just the tip of the iceberg of the new financial era.\n\n# Definition of \"Money\"\n\n\"Money\" is a symbolic concep that has not an intrinsic value in itself. It's value comes from what value people gives to a grain of rice, a piece of metal or paper. Money value is based in its use of case as trading way, posesion unity and store of value. It is important to say that \"money\" and \"currency\" are not identical terms because money is intangible while currency is tangible. Sadly during the time this two concepts have been merged to represent value.\n\n# Brief Chronology of Money\n\nDuring the Neolithic, barter was used as the first form of exchange where the direct negotiation of goods or services were the concept of value and the emergence of \"money\".\n\n[Barter](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2eeuv5m6mitb1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0da197bc3e1e9bff3c24f37272b473c31c6fe3f9)\n\nIn 3000-2500 BC, standards of value were created like weight and quantity to make trading easier. This was used to exchange salt, rice, etc.\n\nIn 1000 BC, the first coins were created in China replacing large metallic objects called \"seashells\" which were used to exchange.\n\n[Chinese Coin](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6gq4zw08mitb1.jpg?width=223&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5e4599bc2f1a6f8b78445962f07c84b5c795a78)\n\nIn 700-600 BC, the first coins were created in Lydia (current Turkey) and later in Persia and Greece spreading them through Europe and Asia.\n\n[Lydya Coin](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vph6dva9mitb1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14fec4af75457a7b944c50810668c8402898aa51)\n\nIn the 9th century AD, paper money was created in China calling it \"bill\" and like coins it represented an amount of money.\n\nIn the 16th century AD, paper money was created and expanded in Europe. In this moment terms like \"certificate,\" \"bills,\" and \"promissory note\" became common when depositing amounts in banks.\n\n[European paper money](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ogih64bbmitb1.jpg?width=274&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2599ad0d31e8a56eadf7b8067820519010caac9c)\n\nBetween the years 1250-1400, the commercialized bank debt crystallized, a set of loans or obligated payment commitments between two entities, such as people, companies, institutions or countries.\n\nBetween 1800-1900, gold standard appeared as a standard of support for any citizen who could convert paper money to an amount of gold. The main European central banks were established and the Fed was created in the United States.\n\n[Gold](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ji0ibe4dmitb1.jpg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a78cb0fef542e0c4d513bc8278f0db3cb1dcb31b)\n\nAfter World War II, in the 1940s, gold standard started to go down and fiat money surged backed by the state statement and credit trust. Because of fiat devaluations and inflation perception about the value of money has changed being only the dollar the only want that maintained the gold standard and became the dominant currency in the internationally.\n\nIn 1971, gold standard on the dollar crashed and since that moment US joined \"fiat\" team and still being the reference internationally. Backing with gold ended and was replaced by faith and credit on the US gov.\n\n[In God We Trust](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lc34zzaemitb1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fd6f700459c2e7ef15d80f061519a7f7a5fb3ea)\n\nIn this moment, money is based on trust and its value is based on purchase power. Money rises if there is interaction between goods and services, the need of them, etc. Basically, it has value because we want it.\n\nIn this moment is when the party starts giving the government the ability to print unlimited paper money without being backed by gold which is an immense risk for financial system as we have been seeing all this time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Brrrrr does not fix a true economy](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e5f6mslfmitb1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e34c22abacb3ddf28508120aba8c4d5befa698eb)\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, ERMA (Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting), first computerized machine for banking purposes, and the MICR (Magnetic-Ink Character Recognition) system were developed.\n\nIn the 1970s, Mainframes were implemented as operational support for data processing and transactions at a local, regional and international level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mainframe](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/68k1cm6hmitb1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7aa44bb83c6b931208c94d3354fda84ecb08b35)\n\nIn the 1980s, a teletext device that allowed interactive consultation of various services called Minitel. In 1982, David Chaum presented the main seed for the creation of a digital currency called \"Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments\", the first public member of CypherPunk, a digital activism focused on protecting the privacy and security of users using technology.\n\n[Minitel](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/doho2csimitb1.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e06b3c40bfa3f9d0c9ad23a1799eeb7f06068d18)\n\nIn the 1990s, Chaum founded DigiCash, the first electronic currency that allowed anonymous payments untraceable by issuing banks, the government or third parties, but the project did not attract much interest from companies and investors. Instead, E-Gold was hailed as the first digital currency system, allowing payments without a credit card and enabling a wide range of online services, but due to the vulnerability and insecurity of the system, cybercrime led it to its final closure in 2007.\n\n[e-gold](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sqlpzfmjmitb1.jpg?width=200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efb36020c6052b38a3bcddf17fd22a32c0da1c01)\n\nWith the rise of Internet and eCommerce in the 90s, Paypal appeared allowing fast transfers of digital money by email and also WebMoney, the biggest payment processors in Russia.\n\n[PayPal and WebMoney](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7h0y8kukmitb1.jpg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f65284e0be6a075972d60bcc3e1ade27590c19f9)\n\nBetween 1997 and 2007, there were some developments that can be considered the prelude of Bitcoin. In 1997, Adam Black developed HashCash, a cryptographic protocol to stop mass spam being sent to mail servers. This protocol used a small \"computational overhead\" to send and email which implied an extra computational cost. This helped to create Proof of Work (PoW) protocol.\n\nIn 1998, Wei Dai created B-Money, a system of value exchange and contract enforcement between anonymous participants bto provide non-traceable services through decentralized transactions and protect the privacy of each participant in a network. This helped to create Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol later.\n\nIn 2004, Hal Finney published his review of Adam Back's HashCash, Reusable Proof of Work (RPoW), which focused on the creation of unique but reusable cryptographic tokens as a process of proofing and issuing digital currencies. However, the validation and protection against the double spend issue was still logged on a trusted central server.\n\nIn 2005, Nick Zsabo proposed Bit Gold, a project he had been working on since 1998. Zsabo pioneered \"smart contracts\" and focused on designing e-commerce protocols between anonymous participants in a network. The project was based on privacy, a decentralized system, and PoW features. However, the project was never carried out due to certain gaps that had not yet been resolved, such as the double spending issue and an efficient mechanism for Bit Gold unit capping.\n\nIn 2008, a mysterious character appears under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, announcing the creation of an electronic currency which he called \"Bitcoin\". He corresponds with Adam Back, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney, sending the latter a copy of the source code for testing purposes.\n\n[Satoshi Nakamoto message](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8xdwieynmitb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88141c9cb2f94c6a1aede50dba83a4728c179a37)\n\nIn 2009, the first transaction of the first Bitcoin is launched, in which Nakamoto sends it to Finney, making him the first \"bitcoiner\". The test has been a success and one year later the capitalization of Bitcoin acquires a value that exceeds a million dollars in the market.\n\n[Not original Satoshi Nakamoto](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mfsmoum26jtb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdaa7c9d99d5c0cbb068003bd04462935af80b35)\n\nIn 2013, Ethereum was  was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Additional founders of Ethereum included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin. In 2014, development work began and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015. Ethereum allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact. \n\n[ETH founders](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/57ngdek3nitb1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3251e3c5e35c47aee854e1f04c8f9f81549c581c)\n\n**TLDR; Crypto is the next financial era.**\n\nIf you have reached this point. You are a hero. Thank you very much for reading this post again. It took me a long afternoon to learn all of this to put it later in a post.\n\nThanks again!\n\nSource: Mainly [https:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/](https:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/)","title":"[LONG READ] TIL: Origin of Cryptocurrencies.

{"selftext":"Allright degenz, this is a bit of a snoozy but these are important basics for understanding the hurdles cryptospace need to overcome before mainspread adoption becomes a reality. \n\nSo, sit your ass down and read!\n\n[This is a smart man](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jgigcsfxwjtb1.jpg?width=598&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6869d0ec5302dfd86c0f31d8dd72b1935f9199b8)\n\nThe blockchain trilemma, a concept introduced by **Vitalik Buterin** (Lord and saviour), revolves around the challenges of reconciling security, decentralization, and scalability in the world of cryptocurrency. These three factors often seem to be in conflict, making it difficult to strike a balance. Let's explore what each of these elements means and why finding a solution is not straightforward.\n\n1. **Decentralization:** This concept involves shifting control away from a single central entity, company, or government and distributing it among smaller groups. In the context of blockchain, decentralization empowers individuals worldwide to govern using their computers (crypto nodes) rather than relying on a central authority.\n2. **Security on the Blockchain:** While blockchain is inherently secure, it's not entirely impervious to hacking. If a hacker gains control of over 50% of the network, they can alter the blockchain and manipulate transactions. More nodes in the network enhance security.\n3. **Scalability:** Scalability in blockchain refers to the network's ability to grow while maintaining transaction speed and output. However, combining scalability with decentralization can compromise security, and strong security measures can hinder the network's ability to scale.\n\nDecentralization and security are the cornerstones of blockchain and cryptocurrency. They eliminate the need for intermediaries and give individuals direct control over their assets. However, this approach comes with the drawback of slower transaction times and scalability challenges due to the amount of information processed.\n\nAdding scalability to the mix presents a threat to security because it narrows the network's distribution, making it easier for attackers to compromise the system. Scalability is crucial for mass adoption of blockchain technology as it ensures convenient and fast transactions.\n\nThe search for a solution to the blockchain trilemma has led to innovative approaches, depending on the project's foundation and reliance on other networks. Some notable solutions include:\n\n1. **Ethereum 2.0 - Sharding and Rollups:** Sharding has become a popular solution to scale projects like Ethereum, which don\u2019t rest on another network. Basically, when a network \u201cshards\u201d, it breaks the transactions that run on the blockchain up into easier sets of data that can be processed by the network quicker. This means more transactions can take place at the same time without congestion. Security is maintained because the different shards interact with each other and send information to the main blockchain so information isn\u2019t compromised.  Rollups allow networks on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain to \u201croll up\u201d multiple transactions into a single off-chain (with validated proof) and then submit the rolled up data to the main chain. It\u2019s kind of like carpooling. Rollups are clever because they reduce the data needed for a transaction, reducing traffic and enhancing speed. \n2. **The Lightning Network - State Channels:** This layer 2 solution offers off-chain channels for faster and more cost-effective transactions. State channels use smart contracts to ensure security.\n3. **Polkadot - Relay Chains and Parachains:** Polkadot promotes interoperability by connecting independent blockchains (parachains) to a central relay chain. Each chain operates independently, allowing for scalability while maintaining overall security.\n\nSolving the blockchain trilemma holds great promise for the future of blockchain. Overcoming these challenges could lead to widespread adoption across various industries, offering a fair and balanced playing field for individuals, free from traditional centralized systems.\n\n**TL;DR:** The blockchain trilemma involves balancing security, decentralization, and scalability in cryptocurrency. Decentralization empowers individuals, but it makes scaling and security challenging. Innovations like Ethereum 2.0's sharding aim to address these issues. Solving this trilemma could lead to widespread blockchain adoption across diverse industries, promoting fairness and independence. \n\n&#x200B;","title":"What is \"The Blockchain Trilemma\" and why should you know what it means","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697020477,"id":"175avur"}

{"selftext":"The fact is that the Ethereum L2 scaling solutions ecosystem has exploded over the past couple of years, but I constantly run across some concerns over the increasing centralization of rollup technology.   \n \n\nI will quote DeFi researcher \u201cAndy\u201d who made a lengthy post about rollup centralization: \u201cDecentralization has been put to the back burner in exchange for immediate feedback loops, accessibility, and user acquisition.\u201d   \n \n\nOne article had a great explanation of this: There are at least 15 highly active layer-2 rollup networks with plenty of activity. Rollups scale Ethereum by batch-processing transactions off-chain and then posting transaction data to the layer-1 chain.   \n \n\nSequencers play a crucial role in the rollup process by ordering transactions, making them cheaper and faster. However, centralized sequencers raise concerns about censorship, single points of failure, MEV extraction, and interoperability. Theoretically, sequencer operators could choose which transactions to include or exclude in blocks, the researcher noted. Moreover, they may become a single point of failure.   \n \n\nRemember when in June Arbitrum stopped processing transactions because its sequencer faced a bug in its batch processor?   \nVitalik Buterin also expressed his concerns about layer-2 \u2018backdoors\u2019 and centralization in August.   \n \n\nSome solutions include Espresso, Neurochain which is built upon the logic of the human brain, this consensus performs better while using fewer resources, than we have AltLayer, Celestia,  Caldera, Cartesi, and Eclipse - an early-stage project, and many are speculating that the narrative around the technology is \u201clight years ahead of reality\u201d and so on and on.   \n \n\n![img](norjpb7tektb1 \"Source:   X\/@ayyyeandy \n \")\n\nEven OP Labs launched Optimism\u2019s first fault-proof system on testnet. This is a big step towards decentralization with a multi-proof dispute system that can include ZK proofs and reduce reliance on a single sequencer.   \n \n\nI don't think we should panic...How about you?

{"selftext":"As a fan of soccer and fantasy football, I decided to start my journey on Sorare September 2021.\n\n# Overview \u26bd\ud83c\udfc0\u26be\n\n**Sorare:** is, it is a global sports game and entertainment platform where you can buy, sell, and trade digital player cards (NFTs) to use in games.\n\n**Sports fantasy games:** it is basically lining up players who, depending on their real-life performance, earn points that can be used to obtain ETH or new cards.\n\nWhen I first joined, there were only a few football tournaments, and the game looked a bit new. Over time, Sorare has been adding different tournaments and sports such as NBA and MLB and become one of the most important Sport Fantasy NFTs place.\n\n# Cards and prices \ud83c\udfb4\ud83d\udcb0\n\nThere are four (4) levels of Scarcity for Sorare NFTs which you can buy, sell, win, or trade:\n\n* **\u2b1b\u00a0Unique** (1 per player per season - this is the only card of its kind in the world)\n* **\ud83d\udfe6 Super Rare** (10 per player per season)\n* **\ud83d\udfe5\u00a0Rare** (100 per player per season)\n* **\ud83d\udfe8\u00a0 Limited** (1000 per player per season)\n* &#x200B;\n\n[Cards Scarcity](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/824xs56spktb1.jpg?width=890&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a108f4799505a2b4c5637be456b63cb1e71d1d7)\n\nThese types of cards can participate in different competitions depending the type and competition type. For now, I only play in Limited since the others are out of my budget.\n\nCard prices have fallen as well as the hype of the NFTs and crypto.\n\nFor example, depending the league you can make a team that can compete for prizes for $100-200. Goalkeepers are the most expensive players since there are fewer of them that play matches.\n\n# Tournaments \u26bd\n\nAs for tournaments, there is a wide variety of tournaments depending on the region, and there are also free card tournaments where you can win prizes.\n\nIn the following picture, you can see all the Limited tournaments I can sign up for and also the top 5 tournaments that are free to play. If you are new, I recommend playing these free tournaments before starting to build your teams to get used to the game.\n\n[Some Tournaments](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qyjvnw1upktb1.jpg?width=859&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9139e8055d10ee141b796b44509977ff56c3203a)\n\nThis is how it looks a lineup for a tournament which have different rules for each sport and tournament.\n\n[Line up](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hn1srwdwpktb1.jpg?width=3070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f8ab6b9f8315c6357c55d89718983d04518d265)\n\n# Prizes \ud83c\udfc6\n\nPrizes usually vary depending on the number of players, matches, and competitions in which you participate. They are not bad, and you can earn some money and cards.

This was the winning team, and I felt so proud.\n\nUsually I use to get 1-2 Limited cards of the Tier 3 with worth like $3 ETH or something like that but sometimes depending their performance you can make some money too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Best lineup prize ever](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7i1tgjrbqktb1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ceea8c3a8ffd9dbfa342bef720b2a1f1efede14)\n\n# Do Your Own Research (DYOR) \ud83d\udd0d\n\nTo decide which players but you have to DYOR a lot so it is important to have the best sources.

You can also try to make a profit just as a trader but I think it is an slow profit strategy and it summarizes into luck and DYOR.\n\n# Closing Remarks \ud83d\udcad\n\nI hope that my perspective from inside the Sorare game has helped you learn and to decide if you were thinking of playing it or not.\n\nThank you very much for reading this post.

{"selftext":"Artist Nelson Saiers\u2019 \u201cRug Pull\u201d highlighted the victims of crypto rug pulls and perceived SEC inaction in safeguarding investors.\n\nStreet vendors abound in downtown Manhattan\u2019s Financial District. But weeks ago, on Sept. 14, an especially unconventional seller set up shop in front of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), transforming a patch of Maiden Lane into a colorful quilt of doormats, each spray painted with the straightforward instruction to \u201cpull.\u201d\u00a0\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cc96hzksjltb1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=bded9262be172cbd666f804381b37538c73d5517\n\nPeople enquired, but they were fake and not really for sale. The wares were part of \u201cRug Pull,\u201d the latest guerilla installation by Nelson Saiers, a New York-based hedge fund manager turned artist who some consider \u201cThe Warhol of Wall Street\u201d or crypto\u2019s most creative activist. As an artwork, \u201cRug Pull\u201d highlights the many victims affected by the type of scam it\u2019s named after.\n\nSaiers only works on-site when it makes sense. His art practice transcends crypto, too. He takes on other topics like unjust incarceration or the profound union of art and math. The artist\u2019s family moved from Ethiopia to the Washington, D.C. area when he was five. He earned his bachelor\u2019s and Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Virginia by age 23.\n\nSaiers caused a buzz with his first guerilla installation in 2018, where he inflated a towering \u201ccrypto rat\u201d in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District, staring down the Federal Reserve.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zwkd89bujltb1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0bb986bff197c3d489d42168d32a591f63b51f1\n\nIts design was directly inspired by iconic New York City blowup rats, which often anchor protests against landlords. In this instance, Saiers added crypto code across the rodent\u2019s body and Bitcoin signs in its eyes.\n\nThe rat also alluded to Warren Buffet, who called crypto \u201crat poison squared\u201d at the time. That was the first crypto winter, where Bitcoin famously fell from $20,000 to $6,000 at the hands of SEC uncertainty and waning faith in the tech.\n\nThat was the year Saiers, who\u2019s only ever held Bitcoin, got involved in crypto. \u201cI did want to inject some support back into the crypto community,\u201d he said.\n\nEven at the height of the madness, he never got caught up in a rug pull. Despite disagreeing with Buffet\u2019s crypto critiques, Saiers cited Buffet\u2019s advice \u201cto be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful\u201d as his strategy for avoiding most scams.\n\nThe artist has another New York gallery show in store during the next year, but just because the \u201cRug Pull\u201d debut is complete doesn\u2019t mean the project is done. Saiers might perform it again. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d repeated a guerilla installation \u2014 he even brought the Bitcoin rat down to Washington, D.C., but while he only has to give the New York Police Department a day\u2019s notice to set up in the city, the Secret Service in D.C. warned him that a bomb squad would need to check out the generator he uses to keep the rodent inflated. Saiers went home instead.","title":"Meet the guerilla artist who executed a crypto 'rug pull' in front of the regulator's office!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697040249,"id":"175horj"}

{"selftext":"#\"time in the market beats timing the market\"\n\nThat is a quote I see posted here and all the crypto subs by self proclaimed \"hodlers\".\n\nUsually when I see this I think the person is new to investing and has been watching too many YouTube influencers. \n\nThrowing a little bit of your earnings at your investment is obviously a proven strategy that is applied to many things from even savings and retirement funds.\n\nBut many people seem to think it is the only way to make money in stocks and crypto. And use it as a way to disregard trading.\n\nWhat I like to do is something I call volatility surfing. You sit back and wait for a tasty wave from a sudden drop or sudden pump.\n\nThis is where technical analysis and the 24 hour chart come into play. Even the shorter time charts.\n\nI don't claim to be able to tell future prices. Maybe someone better at TA can explain to you what they see in the charts for price prediction. \n\nBut when sudden movement happens you can use the chart to map where prices will land while the price settles from a pump or dip based on where they landed in the past. This is best applied when the price has been crabbing and speculation either draw the price down or up. \n\nThis was seen when the ETH ETFs were announced and ETH passed the 1650 resistance for the first time in a month. The price ended up topping at 1730 before coming back down to the low 1600s. 1730 is a mappable number that has been observed in the past.\n\nAnother instance of this is when ETH fell recently on the news of the struggle in the middle east. The price fell below 1550 which it hasn't done in a while. It is now back up to over that resistance which to me is a good sign of it's return to around 1610-1620. Unless tension in the middle east explodes.(no pun intended)\n\nThe middle east drama may be just a speed bump and a return to 1730 this month is still possible. It's still uptober after all. \n\nI just wanted to take the time to educate people on the other methods to make money in crypto. The \"holding till $1\" narrative may leave you holding a bag without taking profit. With ETH it isn't the big of a deal because ETH is here to stay and it's going to be around for the next bull run regardless. But just be a little open minded.\n\nHave fun traders. And enjoy the rest of the week.\n\n#PEACE!","title":"Timing the market vs. time in the market vs. ????","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697054221,"id":"175n98i"}

Try incognito mode of the browser to test any doubtful websites. See whether it's asking you to connect your wallet or not.\n* The airdrop posts you see on platform X are fake and all are wallet drainers. Never connect your wallets.\n* Never give your private key or seed phrases to anyone. No official website asks for your seed phrase to enter anywhere.\n* Check the website URL properly before doing any transactions. It's better to bookmark frequently visiting Web3 platforms.\n* Don't keep all your assets in a single wallet. Always use disposable wallets for smaller transactions.\n* Try to split up your digital assets into multiple wallet and migrate them to properly secured wallet.\n* Keep monitoring your wallet transactions. If you find any suspicious activities, take immediate action such as revoking access to dapps by using **revoke.cash** website\n* Use security extensions and apps like **Pocket Universe**, **Scam Sniffer** that helps you avoiding potential scam websites.\n\nI hope you will take these tips seriously.

{"selftext":"Pending the post just made by a user... Credit to him actually.... I decided to highlight some ways to protect us all from something like this.\nPlease do well to ensure your safety in situations like hacks\ud83e\udd0d\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\nProtecting your cryptocurrency from wallet drainers is crucial. Here are some steps to help you enhance the security of your cryptocurrency holdings:\n\n1. Use a Hardware Wallet: Consider using a hardware wallet, which is a physical device that stores your cryptocurrency offline, making it immune to online attacks.\n\n2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use 2FA on your exchange accounts and wallet services. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.\n\n3. Choose a Strong Password: Use a strong and unique password for your wallet and exchange accounts. Avoid using easily guessable information.\n\n4. Regularly Update Software: Keep your wallet and software up to date with the latest security patches and updates to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n\n5. Be Cautious with Links and Emails: Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unverified sources, as they may contain malware that can compromise your wallet's security.\n\n6. Backup Your Wallet: Create secure backups of your wallet's private keys and recovery phrases. Store these backups in multiple physical locations, such as a safe or a safety deposit box.\n\n7. Use Cold Storage: Keep the majority of your cryptocurrency in a cold storage wallet (offline) to reduce exposure to potential threats.\n\n8. Beware of Phishing Attempts: Be cautious of phishing attempts. Verify the authenticity of websites and email communications to prevent falling for scams.\n\n9. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common cryptocurrency scams and threats, such as phishing, SIM swapping, and social engineering attacks.\n\n10. Limit Exposure: Only share your public wallet address when necessary. Keep your private keys and personal information private.\n\n11. Secure Your Devices: Ensure that the devices you use to access your cryptocurrency are secure. Use antivirus software, firewalls, and maintain good security practices.\n\n12. Use Reputable Exchanges: Choose well-established and reputable cryptocurrency exchanges and services to minimize the risk of losing your funds.\n\n13. Diversify Holdings: Avoid putting all your cryptocurrency holdings in a single wallet or exchange. Diversifying can reduce potential losses in case of a security breach.\n\n14. Consider a Multisignature Wallet: Multisignature wallets require multiple private keys to authorize transactions, making it more secure.\n\n15. Stay Informed: Keep up with the latest developments in cryptocurrency security and best practices to adapt to new threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nRemember that no security measure is foolproof, so it's essential to stay vigilant and take all precautions to protect your cryptocurrency investments.","title":"Protecting your cryptocurrency from wallet drainers is crucial.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697092231,"id":"17608ge"}

With official collaboration we can reuse the map for new events, and activities in the future etc.  \n\n\nFinally in terms of \"speculative value\" this whole thing could be a solid bet since Zuckerberg has not given up on the Metaverse... in fact I thing he's pushing even harder.

{"selftext":"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, security remains a paramount concern. Ethereum, one of the leading blockchain platforms, has seen its fair share of security issues, with wallet draining attacks being a persistent threat. In this article, we'll explore what Ethereum wallet draining is and provide some notable examples to emphasize the importance of securing your digital assets.\n\n\u2022 Understanding Ethereum Wallet Drainers\n\nEthereum wallet draining, often referred to as a \"smart contract attack\" or \"reentrancy attack,\" occurs when a malicious actor exploits vulnerabilities in a smart contract to siphon funds from a user's wallet. These attacks are possible due to coding errors or flaws in the way smart contracts interact with one another. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the victim's wallet and drains the funds, leaving the user in financial distress.\n\n\u2022 Notable Examples\n\n1. **The DAO Attack (2016):** The most infamous Ethereum wallet draining incident, The DAO, was a decentralized autonomous organization built on the Ethereum blockchain. In June 2016, a vulnerability in The DAO's smart contract code allowed an attacker to siphon off a significant amount of Ether (ETH), leading to a contentious hard fork in the Ethereum network. This event eventually resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\n2. **Parity Multisig Wallet Exploit (2017):** In July 2017, a flaw in the Parity multisig wallet smart contract code led to a wallet draining incident. An individual accidentally triggered a vulnerability, which locked up over 513,000 ETH. Despite multiple efforts to resolve the situation, the funds remain inaccessible to this day.\n\n3. **bZx DeFi Protocol Attack (2020):** In February 2020, the bZx decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol suffered multiple exploits, resulting in the loss of users' funds. The attackers took advantage of vulnerabilities in the protocol's smart contracts, draining substantial amounts of Ethereum and other assets.\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum wallet draining attacks have, over the years, demonstrated the need for heightened vigilance when managing digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. By staying informed and implementing robust security measures, users can protect their assets from falling into the wrong hands and ensure a safer experience in the world of decentralized finance.","title":"Ethereum Wallet Drainers: What you need to know","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697109586,"id":"1764k0m"}

Usually I tend to go for a 60\/30\/10 split for prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place.\n\nIdeas:\n\n- Instead of prizes, we could split the 5k Donuts amongst all the participants to seed all their wallets so you dont have to buy donuts to participate.\n\n- Or, siphon off a small % of the prizepool to provide free buy-ins for people if they otherwise wouldn't join. Then the rest split into big prizes for the winners.\n\n\nNote:\nIn terms of taxes and accountancy please double check before entering what the implications of each trade may be in your country.

Some examples are Uniswap, Honeyswap etc . The basic idea it follows is to maintain a certain ratio for a particular pool that's how the price fluctuates like for Example DONUT\/XDAI I swap my DONUTS to XDAI here only , we are able to do this because it's pool is already there with some ratio,\n\nLiquidity Pools: \n\nA liquidity pool is one of the main reason we are able to swap our Token or coin easily into one another , So Liquidity Pool is a kind of reserve funds or Locked funds in a smart contract on blockchain . Any user can also provide Liquidity is any pool if they want to and in return they earn trading fees and portion of the trading volume , For Example we have to provide liquidity for ETH\/DAI pair so we have to deposit equal pair of ETH and DAI in the pool , then smart contract calculates our share of pool and in return we earn rewards respective to that share only. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you have like the post , I will try to keep up in the next post.

The most recent bullish prediction comes from British multinational bank Standard Chartered which believes that the Ethereum price could climb higher than  $8,000.](https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum\/standard-chartered-ethereum-35000\/)\n\n**Factors That Could Trigger The Rise**\nGeoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank has revealed his forecast for the Ethereum price in a research note. According to the researcher, he sees big things in the future of the digital asset which could climb higher than $8,000 in the coming years.\n\nTalking about the asset\u2019s valuation, Kendrick points toward the many use cases for Ethereum that have emerged over the years but also sees more use cases emerging as time goes on. One of those is the much-coveted gaming and asset tokenization sector.\n\nAlso, the Standard Chartered researcher said that they expect that Ethereum will see more growth than the pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. While he expects Bitcoin to rise 3.5x, they believe Ethereum will rise 5 from current levels.\n\n\u201cWe think the path higher for ETH prices may take longer than for BTC, but we see ETH eventually reaching a higher price multiple than BTC relative to current levels (5.0x versus 3.5x),\u201d the researcher said.\n\nHe also believes that Ethereum would go on to further register its dominance in the space, especially with the Layer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum that have popped up to enhance the network. This, he believes, would lead to an increase in the Ethereum profit-earnings ratio (P\/E ratio).","title":"Standard Chartered Says Ethereum Price Can Reach $35,000, Here\u2019s When","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697168855,"id":"176pppq"}

Though Dexter believed the problem was addressed after Singh removed some code, the special treatment ultimately remained in place.\n\nSchoening was fired in August 2022, after some FTX executives circulated allegedly doctored inappropriate messages she sent.

{"selftext":"  \n\nOracles play a crucial role in Web3 development by enabling blockchain-based applications to interact with real-world data and systems. Here's an explanation of their function in Web3 development:\n\n1. Data Integration: Oracles bridge the gap between decentralized smart contracts and external data sources, including APIs, IoT devices, and traditional databases. They provide a mechanism for smart contracts to access off-chain data, such as weather information, stock prices, sports scores, and more.\n\n2. Trustworthiness: Oracles are responsible for fetching and verifying external data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability before it's used in a smart contract. Trust in the data provided by an oracle is essential for the security and integrity of decentralized applications.\n\n3. Event Triggering: Oracles can trigger smart contract execution based on predefined conditions or events in the real world. For example, a DeFi contract might automatically execute a trade when a specific stock price reaches a certain level, all determined by data from an oracle.\n\n4. Interoperability: Oracles facilitate interoperability between different blockchains and protocols. They enable the exchange of information and value across various blockchain networks, making it possible for Web3 applications to access data from multiple sources.\n\n5. Decentralization: In Web3 development, it's essential to maintain the decentralized nature of applications. Some oracles operate in a decentralized manner, relying on multiple data sources and validators to ensure data accuracy, thus preserving the trustless nature of blockchain applications.\n\n6. Customization: Oracles can be customized to meet the specific needs of a decentralized application. Developers can choose or build oracles tailored to their project's requirements, including data frequency, security measures, and redundancy.\n\n7. Real-World Use Cases: Oracles enable a wide range of real-world use cases in Web3, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), supply chain management, insurance, gaming, and more. They make it possible to create smart contracts that respond to real-world events and conditions.\n\nIn summary, oracles are essential components in Web3 development, connecting decentralized applications to the external world and enabling them to operate effectively and securely. They expand the capabilities of smart contracts, opening up a vast array of use cases and opportunities for innovation in the decentralized ecosystem.","title":"Unlocking Web3's Potential: The Crucial Role of Oracles in Bridging Blockchain and the Real World","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697185060,"id":"176tsu0"}

Ethereum's position at the forefront of blockchain technology is a key factor.\n\nThe research doesn't stop at 2026, projecting Ethereum's value between $26,000 and $35,000 by the year 2040. This grander valuation considers emerging use cases and revenue streams, particularly in the gaming and tokenization sectors.\n\nThe research also acknowledges the potential impact of U.S. regulations, particularly concerning spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The more transactions L2s are settling when that happens, the higher the aggregate L1 fees will reach I believe.\n\nSo I'd like to see EIP-4844 and data sharding implemented and giving L2s a 1,000x capacity boost, which could drive down L1 fees to astronomically low levels in the interim. But once L2 is using up all of the new Data Availability, by processing 10,000 - 100,000 transactions per second, then further demand growth will just push up L1 fees.\n\nBest case scenario is L1 fees amounting to 10c per L2 transaction\u2014due to large L1 settlement and Rollup validation transactions\u2014at 100,000 L2 transactions per second.\n\nThat would come out to $864 million in fee revenue per day ($10,000\u00d760\u00d760\u00d724), or $315 billion in fee revenue per year.\n\nAnd on top of that, ETH would be the primary currency and store of value in the L2 techstrate, which would be facilitating massive amounts of economic activity.

{"selftext":"\u2022 G20 nations endorse the regulatory pathway for cryptocurrency laid out in a Synthesis Paper.\n\n\n\u2022 This pivotal decision stems from a collaboration between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\n\n##A Unified Approach to Crypto Regulation##\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency stands at the cusp of a significant transition. The G20, a conglomerate of the world\u2019s major economies, has voiced its support for a regulatory framework detailed in a joint Synthesis Paper penned by two stalwarts in global finance: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\n\n##Demystifying the IMF-FSB Collaboration##\n\n\nFor those less familiar with the nuances of global finance, understanding the weight of this decision necessitates a deeper dive into the entities behind the Synthesis Paper. The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, is an organization of 190 countries. Its primary goal is to ensure the stability of the global monetary system, encompassing exchange rates, international trade, and global payments.\n\nMeanwhile, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system to promote stability.\n\nTheir combined expertise led to the creation of the Synthesis Paper, a document meticulously detailing the regulatory nuances required to oversee the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. With the rapid growth and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, achieving a consensus on regulations has been challenging. This paper seeks to bridge that gap, offering a balanced approach that ensures both innovation in the crypto space and security for its investors.\n\nThe decision by the G20 to adopt this Synthesis Paper holds monumental importance. These nations collectively represent two-thirds of the world population and 85% of the global GDP. Their endorsement symbolizes not only a consensus amongst the most influential economies but also sets a precedent for other nations to consider this well-thought-out framework.\n\nIt\u2019s imperative to understand that, in the constantly evolving realm of digital assets, having a clear regulatory guideline is crucial. This not only ensures the protection of investors but also paves the way for mainstream adoption, fostering trust in the system. The G20\u2019s alignment with the recommendations laid out in the IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper is a testament to the collaborative efforts of global financial leaders in acknowledging the significance of cryptocurrencies in the future of finance.","title":"IMF-FSB Crypto Framework Gets G20\u2019s Nod for International Implementation \u2013 Are Cryptocurrencies and Ethereum in Real Danger?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697285358,"id":"177o3lo"}

Data gaps hinder regulators' and investors' understanding of DeFi and its associated risks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The EU regulatory framework for crypto-assets, known as MiCA, will undergo regular review and may require additional regulatory action concerning DeFi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- ESMA commits to actively monitoring DeFi developments, contributing to international initiatives, and providing insights to inform the future review of MiCA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The risks and challenges identified in this report aim to shape the future regulatory landscape for DeFi in the EU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- ESMA will work collaboratively with international organizations to foster a common understanding and approach to the phenomenon of DeFi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Part 2: **Categorization of Smart Contracts in Decentralised Finance**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Smart contracts, introduced on the Ethereum blockchain in 2015, serve as the foundation of DeFi by enabling automated financial transactions without intermediaries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The open-source nature of smart contracts fosters financial innovation but also introduces significant technological complexity, necessitating regulatory understanding and monitoring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- ESMA's article categorizes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain into five main categories: **Financial**, **Operational**, **Token**, **Wallet**, and **Infrastructure**, based on on-chain data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Two waves of smart contract deployment have been observed, one from 2017-2018 and another from late 2020 to January 2023, with the latter being significantly more diverse in terms of categories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The first wave primarily consisted of simpler transactions such as lending protocols and lotteries, while the second wave introduced complex applications like derivatives management, prediction markets, insurance, yield farming, and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The growing complexity and interconnectivity of smart contracts raise concerns, including user difficulties in understanding the system and increased dependency risks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Vulnerabilities in one smart contract can have a cascading impact on others, affecting the overall system, which emphasizes the need for closer monitoring and policy initiatives in the DeFi space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- ESMA's categorization model, designed to adapt to changes in the dataset, enhances understanding of DeFi and helps identify significant risks associated with this evolving ecosystem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https:\/\/www.esma.europa.eu\/press-news\/hearings\/webinar-findings-articles-decentralised-finance#respond-anchor](https:\/\/www.esma.europa.eu\/press-news\/hearings\/webinar-findings-articles-decentralised-finance#respond-anchor)","title":"\ud83d\udca5 Decentralized Finance in the EU: Developments and Risks - New Report by ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) - Your Thoughts?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697306168,"id":"177v45b"}

StarkEx was chosen because its provider - StarkWare - has had the experience in running spot-trading exchanges in production.

For instance, the off-chain matching engine would sequence trades and consequently inform traders on the final outcome of their trades.\n\nTo give power to the community of traders, dYdX allowed traders to earn a governance token called DYDX whenever they traded on the platform.

{"selftext":"Hi guys,\n\nHave you ever experienced a jaw-dropping price swing, a life-changing investment decision, or a memorable encounter related to cryptocurrencies? Maybe you've got a funny or educational crypto story that you can't wait to tell.\n\nI have two or three out of which I would like to share the one which could have made me rich overnight. So, I was really keen to invest in a NFT project back when it was hyped and everyone was going crazy on NFTs. I was searching for new projects to invest in to that were yet to launched and finalized two projects.\n\n* **NEST Arcade:** It was a project which was supposed to be a gaming platform where you could play and earn using the NFTs of the project and they had multiple games in line to release out of which the first one was flappy bird copy.\n* **Mars Colony:** It was a project which was kind of simulation game where you could buy plots and build your colony and after that you could earn their token CLNY daily for just owning the land and earn additional tokens for completing different quests.\n\nSo finally I decided to go all in NEST Arcade and invested around 50 SOL when SOL was around $240 and a single NFT costed around 4-5 SOL on average but it was rug pulled and the games never really launched and after the SOL crash and this each NFT is worth around 0.2 SOL. Meanwhile I could have made a lot of profit if I had invested the same amount in Mars Colony because the plot's price went 100x because they were sold on the first day and there was so much demand. The project Mars Colony is dead itself right now but I could have made a quick profit which I was looking for.\n\nIn this bear market everything seems dry so share your stories in the comments.\n\nThanks.","title":"Your Most Memorable Crypto Stories!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697434571,"id":"178ysz4"}

{"selftext":"**TL;DR: Use tools to revoke token approvals and use \"disposable\" hot wallets to interact with third parties to add another security layer between your main wallet and third parties.**\n\nI think today is the best time to share this knowledge because there are a lot of discussions about the new airdrop that is being promoted and everybody should learn about the risks of \"connecting\" a wallet to a third party and Token Infinite Approval Exploits.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bavlhr2xgiub1.jpg?width=200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36cc3752990ca947e28482f3e6d40b97bd554f8d\n\n# Token Approval\n\nI am going to explain how token approvals works:\n\n* Approve() function: It gives permission to third parties to use  some tokens on your behalf and  it needs basically three things:\n\n1. The address of the token owner\n2. The address of the one who gets the tokens\n3. The amount of tokens to be moved\n\n* transferFrom() function: Checks that the spender has enough tokens to send and has enough permissions from the token owner. If both are true, it makes the transaction and reduces the amount the spender can move in the future by the moved amount.\n\n# Infinite Token Approval\n\nInfinite token approval is a contract that allows third parties to act instead of having to approve one by one.\n\nSometimes there are apps that ask for approval contracts that allow them to move infinite amount of tokens and this is exactly where hacker focus their efforts. This are some ways they try to make us sign a malicious approval contract:\n\n* Most common one is sending phishing emails or with fake websites that tries to impersonate the legit app or project. This ones use to ask to approve infinite amount of tokens and then drain your wallet.\n* Exploiting a vulnerability in a smart contract. Basically finding a bug of a backdoor that allow hackers take advantage of it.\n\n# How To Protect From Infinite Token Approval\n\n* Only approve this kind of contracts if you really need too and if you are 200% sure that the app is legit.\n* Stay updated on security news and alerts. Twitter and r\/CryptoCurrency are really good places\n* Use tools to revoke token approvals like [https:\/\/revoke.cash\/](https:\/\/revoke.cash\/) or Etherscan's Token Approval tool [https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tokenapprovalchecker?type=0&search=](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tokenapprovalchecker?type=0&search=) (Tutorial: [https:\/\/info.etherscan.com\/tokenapprovals\/](https:\/\/info.etherscan.com\/tokenapprovals\/))\n* Always use \"disposable\" hot wallets to interact with third parties. This way you create another security layer between your main wallet and third parties.\n* Avoid phishing links from search engines using AdBlock or better, Brave Browser with its integrated AdBlock.\n\nIt may seem that taking these security measures is exhausting and an extra effort but I assure you that it is worth it and eventually you get used to it.\n\nBetter safe than sorry.\n\n&#x200B;","title":"How To Avoid Token Infinite Approval Exploits and Stay Safe in Crypto","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697438842,"id":"178zt5r"}

During the time of network congestion , high network fees , energy-intensive mining .That's how, Ethereum's Merge (formerly 'Eth2.0') came  instead of running specialized hardware equipment, validators for PoS consensus need to have a certain minimum amount of native tokens staked in the chain. The amount of ETH you've got staked in the network ensures that you won't act against your own interest. The reasoning is that you wouldn't act as a malicious actor to compromise the same network you're invested in. In exchange, you're rewarded for helping secure the network. \n\nSolana already uses PoS, by the way. And it combines it with this innovative little mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH).  But for Solana, combining two consensus mechanisms makes its network highly performant. A transaction fee on Solana is peanuts. \n\n## Transaction Speed : \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/90iaiu4axjub1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11f07162480ffca20df981bf4f60b2fd8e35c68c\n\nWhen it comes to transaction speed, Solana takes the cake. In fact, when it comes to the processing of transactions too, Solana is one of the fastest blockchains in the game. This obviously has to do with the network architectures. See, Ethereum prioritized decentralization, whereas Solana focused on throughput.\u00a0Let's take a look at the numbers. \n\nAfter merge , Ethereum can manage up to 10000 TPS where Compare this with Solana, which can process over 50,000 TPS, without risk of crashing.  \n\n## Scalability : \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s4jlyoc3yjub1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ed72d94d89dcabd9f302bc930df627357f32f3a\n\nSolana can afford to be stateless thanks to its PoH consensus. PoH involves timestamping the transactions, which ensures that the transactions are verified in sequential order.\u00a0And what happens if they're in sequence? You can do away with consensus verification of the present state. Moreover, you can also do away with the mempool. That's the name for the temporary space for blocks that are awaiting validation\u00a0(It's sort of like a purgatory for blocks). \n\nDoing away with these functions allows Solana to scale much more lightly and easily. Oh, and Solana doesn't need any Layer 2 solutions either. It just *works*.\u00a0It does have one major vulnerability though.\u00a0 \n\nThe fewer number of nodes do mean that Solana is way more centralized compared to Ethereum. (It's best to think of decentralization on a scale. Not all decentralization is good, and not all centralization is bad. They have their specific use cases, as well as tradeoffs.\u00a0Another challenge with Ethereum scalability comes in the form of TVL. Sure, when it comes to market capitalization, Ethereum is the clear winner.\u00a0 ","title":"The Battle of L1 Dominance : ETH vs SOL","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697457049,"id":"17945na"}

{"selftext":"**Non Fungible What?**\n\nNFT stands for Non-Fungible Token and represents a digital certificate of ownership. NFT's use blockchain technology to verify the uniqueness and ownership of a digital or physical asset. The term fungible means that an item is replaceable by another identical item. For example, A US dollar bill is fungible because it can be replaced with another $1 bill. NFTs, however, are non-fungible, meaning they cannot be replaced or divided; Each NFT is unique and there only ever exists a single copy.\n\n**A Brief History**\n\nNon Fungible Tokens (NFTs) came into creation in the mid-2010s. Quantum is commonly cited as the first NFT ever created as was minted on the Namecoin blockchain on May 2, 2014 (and recently sold at a Sotheby's action for 1.4M dollars in June 2021). In January 2018, ERC-721 (created January 2018) was established creating the Non-Fungible Token standard on the Ethereum network. Other working standards have since been proposed such as ERC-998 and ERC-1155.\n\n**What Can NFTs be used for?**\n\nAs mentioned above, an NFT is a digital certificate that proves ownership. As such, they are a great standard to verify ownership of in-game collectibles and characters, real estate (virtual and real world) and even a [tweet](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/04\/13\/jack-dorseys-first-tweet-nft-went-on-sale-for-48m-it-ended-with-a-top-bid-of-just-280\/). Another use case where NFT is becoming disruptive is in the ticketing industry (for real world events) and offers many benefits over traditional ticket purchasing methods such as preventing fake tickets, reducing costs and instant creation\/transfer of the tickets.\n\n**... And Of Course, Pixelated Art**\n\nHowever, the most common use case for NFTs are for digital art collections. Below are some of the most popular NFT collections of all time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CryptoPunks\ud83d\udcf7](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iwd2vl67tkub1.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=86adea4672056e08410b93992e91c61391c410c7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bored Ape Yacht Club](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cmwa3ex9tkub1.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=89fc82366e7c03a06fd1517920f8d078a0ccd5e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CryptoKitties](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cyve705btkub1.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=60e8a92e0f6efe399d6bb68d5d93a7d058215d90)\n\n**Meteoric Rise of NFTs**\n\nNFTs have transformed the way we interact with digital assets. In 2021 alone, the NFT market saw trading volume reach approximately $10 to $17 billion. Digital art sales skyrocketed, with a single NFT artwork by Beeple (The First Five Thousand Days) selling for $69.3 million at auction.\n\nOther notable NFT sales include:\n\n* Clock - $52.7M\n* HUMAN ONE - $28.9M\n* CryptoPunk #5822 - $23.7M\n\n**The Fall of NFTs**\n\nNFT trading volume continues to fall, down 95% since its peak in January 2022. This can be attributed to many factors, including the overall market being down, market saturation (rapid growth of NFTs and oversaturation of digital assets), being a highly speculative asset, scams\/fraud in the space and chaging trends in the crypto scene. In addition, certain NFT collections (e.g. CryptoKitties) have been targeted and labeled as securities by the SEC.\n\n**Their Future**\n\nIts important to note when we say \"the fall of NFTs\", we are primarily talking about digital art collections. While trade volume can be a significant indicator, digital art is only one facet of the NFT market. In addition to the other use cases listed above, Real World Assets (RWA) are an emerging use case for NFTs, where NFTs prove ownership (or partial ownership) of real world items. The true value and potential of NFTs lie in the underlying technology and the unique digital ownership they represent.","title":"The Rise and Fall of Non-Fungible Tokens and Their Future Outlook","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697467171,"id":"1797ix3"}

{"selftext":"TL;DR - Perpetual DEX projects with good fundamentals and tokenomics can become one of the biggest narratives in cryptosphere by next bull run. Provided some important data and the potential of these Perp DEXs.\n\n**Finding a new narrative before the bull run is necessary** to make better profits than crypto normies. Initially, I thought SocialFi projects like Friend.Tech or better protocols would become the next narrative. But I am very much convinced that it's like a Ponzi scheme and only for shiller \"influencers\" to exit with followers' money. So, what's next? NFT and DeFi were the narratives in the previous bull run. Dexes are rising and falling throughout two bullruns. \n\nNow, I found out that **Perpetual Dex can be one of the narrative** or highly profitable projects in the upcoming bullrun. Why? Here's some data: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/znq3xrc5fmub1.jpg?width=1499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98842acb279514f28918977e2315b48f7d5f087f\n\n# Opportunities in Perp DEXs are huge. Here is some key information:\n\nTop Perp DEXs had $363 million in daily trading volume, compared to the top CEXs, which had $45 billion in volume on the same day.\n\nPerp DEXs are so early, with less than 1% marketshare in the crypto derivatives market. Centralized exchanges have the majority of volume and marketshare. \n\nDYDX is leading the Perp Dex market with over 70% of the monthly trading volume.\n\nHMX overtook GMX and emerged as a leading AMM-based Perp DEX. \n\nLess than 2,800 traders are currently trading on Perp DEXs. \n\nIn the long run, Perp DEXs with orderbooks (like, in Binance and other CEXs) could attract more people to DEXs, as evidenced by DYDX on a smaller scale. \n\nThe DYDX Chain launch is going to be a major milestone for the entire Perp DEX space. \n\nPerp DEXs can emerge as one of the biggest themes for both builders and investors in the near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9777jgu6fmub1.jpg?width=2012&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=086487a9467345cebf0ffa29374acc0f79099a32\n\nPerpetual DEX, a.k.a. Perp Dex is a kind of decentralized trading platform that permits perpetual contracts to be traded continuously. A type of derivative contract known as a perpetual contract simulates the price movement of an underlying asset without having a time limit. Without owning the underlying asset, they enable traders to speculate on the price of commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies.\n\n# How Perpetual DEX's work?\n\n**1. Liquidity Pools:** To enable trading, perpetual DEXs rely on liquidity pools. In these pools, traders place their assets, which act as collateral for their perpetual contracts.\n\n**2. Funding Mechanism:** In order to keep the market price of perpetual contracts near the spot price of the underlying asset, a funding mechanism is necessary. This is accomplished by a funding system that rewards traders for taking positions that run counter to the current market trend, maintaining equilibrium, and avoiding price divergence.\n\n**3. Leverage Trading:** Perpetual DEXs frequently facilitate leverage trading, enabling investors to enlarge their positions and potential gains or losses. Trading with a portion of the total contract value is made possible by allowing traders to choose their preferred leverage ratio.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nYou might have known how much liquidation, profit, and trading volume is generated on Binance, Bybit, and other centralized exchanges in leveraged margin trades, a.k.a., perpetual contract trades. Imagine a more educated trader who has some knowledge of DEXs and huge chunks of money to gamble on, but they don't want to trust a centralized exchange.\n\n**I am not telling you to trade with leveraged margin. If you aren't familiar, you will be rekt. Just analyze the coins\/tokens of those Perp DEXs that provide this service.**\n\nI started my crypto journey from a CEX and now familiar with DEX trades, LPs, Stakes, Yields, etc. Similarly, hundreds of thousands will be going to decentralized exchanges for leveraged margin trading. Profit or loss doesn't matter; the house always wins! So, keep an eye on these protocols, their token price, and, more importantly, their tokenomics and other fundamentals.

{"selftext":"Do you have that feeling that Ethereum now stands at a pivotal crossroads, which stands to shape its future in a big way? I'm talking about Cancun-Deneb upgrade...  \n\n\nAs per Messari\u2019s State of Ethereum in Q3 2023 report, L2 transactions accounted for two times as many transactions on the mainnet, i.e., nearly 66% of all transactions within the ecosystem.  \n\n\nL2 solutions are increasingly becoming the backbone of Ethereum\u2019s scalability strategy. L2s are faster, cheaper, and somewhat more secure, but they\u2019re still a work in progress. As Elena Sinelnikova (Metis DAO) explained, Optimistic Rollups are still working on their Fraud Proof systems, and ZK Rollups are trying to ensure they work smoothly with Ethereum without any hiccups.  \n\n\nBut to be honest, while L2 solutions undoubtedly offer high scalability, they also face certain challenges. That's why NeuroChain blew my mind, as well as the latest news about Eclipse.  \n\n\nWe have another big problem as well... as the Ethereum network has continued to expand, it has faced greater regulatory scrutiny, remember when the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Tornado Cash addresses?? Resulting in major Ethereum relays having to censor transactions, adding another layer of complexity to the network\u2019s ongoing decentralization dilemma in the process.  \n\n\nA major development coming to the Ethereum network in the near future is the Cancun-Deneb upgrade, which aims to make roll-up transactions more cost-effective than ever before. To elaborate, the upgrade stands to be a game-changer for the ecosystem, making its L2 solutions even more competitive via the introduction of EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding, which will significantly reduce the costs of roll-up transactions.  \n\n\nDo you have high hopes for this upgrade?

{"selftext":"**Bringing Polkadot tech to Ethereum**\n\nELI5\nThis article discusses the idea of bringing the Polkadot tech stack to Ethereum. It explores the problems that arise from having multiple app chains on Ethereum and proposes a solution using shared sequencers. The article also draws parallels between Polkadot and Ethereum and suggests reusing the Polkadot relay chain in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nImportant Takeaways:\n1. Fragmented decentralization: Having multiple app chains on Ethereum leads to fragmentation of validator sets and creates barriers for developers to launch their own app chains.\n2. Composability challenges: Interacting with different app chains becomes difficult due to different consensus mechanisms and the need to set up cross-chain bridges. Shared sequencers can help address this issue by allowing composable rollups to share blocks with each other.\n3. Developer experience: Building app chains with decentralization and bridging capabilities is complex. Shared sequencers can abstract the decentralization aspect, but there are still standards that chains need to follow to be compatible.\n4. Polkadot's solution: Polkadot has already solved many of the problems related to multi-chain interoperability and shared sequencing. The relay chain acts as a shared sequencer, ordering transactions across parachains and verifying their execution.\n5. Bringing Polkadot tech to Ethereum: The article suggests reusing the Polkadot relay chain in the Ethereum ecosystem by removing the verification part and committing the order of transactions to the L1. This approach leverages the battle-tested technology of Polkadot and allows for settlement of active parachains on Ethereum.\n\n[SOURCE](https:\/\/ethresear.ch\/t\/bringing-polkadot-tech-to-ethereum\/17104)\n\nAuthor: u\/Buzzalu\n\n[Link](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/179laa3\/daily_general_discussion_october_17_2023_utc0\/k57tbwo\/)","title":"[DD Nominated Comment] **Bringing Polkadot tech to Ethereum** ELI5 This article discusses the idea of bringing the Polkadot tech stack to Ethereum.

He joined the ETH founders in early 2014\n\n# Role\n\nJeff basically was part of the developer team and begun his software implementation, which was later renamed Go Ethereum, and then simplified to \"Geth2. Funny thing is that at the same time another ETH founder was creating his version on C++ but both didn't know about the other project.

{"selftext":"Hi r\/ethtrader,\n\nI\u2019m u\/cozy__sheets and I work on our Community team, supporting products that focus on subreddits, like Community Points. \n\n**TL;DR:** We recently made the decision to sunset the Community Points beta, including Special Memberships, by November 8th. At that point, you\u2019ll also no longer see Points in your Reddit Vault nor earn any more Points in your communities. Though we saw some future opportunities for Community Points, there was no path to scale it broadly across the platform.\n\n**The corporate context**\n\nThe regulatory environment has added to scalability limitations. Though the moderators and communities that supported Community Points have been incredible partners - as it\u2019s evolved, the product is no longer set up to scale.\n\nWe still love the idea that inspired Community Points. Specifically, finding better ways to improve community governance and empower communities and contributions. Part of why we\u2019re winding down Community Points is because we\u2019re able to scale several products that accomplish what the Community Points program was trying to accomplish, while being easier to adopt and understand. \n\nOne example is the [new Contributor Program](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/reddit\/comments\/16ryhv9\/celebrating_great_content_is_as_good_as_gold\/), actively rolling out, which will give eligible users the ability to earn cash based on the karma and gold they\u2019ve earned on qualifying contributions. Other examples include shipped features that were originally part of the Community Points beta that we believe any community should have access to, like [subreddit karma](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/modnews\/comments\/zk9qn8\/subreddit_karma_is_now_in_automod\/) and [gifs](https:\/\/support.reddithelp.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/7765031267988-How-do-I-add-GIFs-in-comments-).\n\n**But why now?**\n\nAs we started rolling out an [improved reddit.com experience](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/reddit\/comments\/15eobm3\/an_improved_loggedout_web_experience\/), we realized that without an outsized commitment to resources, Community Points wouldn\u2019t migrate well to that updated experience. \n\nTime and efforts previously spent on Community Points can now be directed to more scalable programs - like the Contributor Program - which we believe can provide value to more redditors. \n\n**More info**\n\nThe Community Points product, including Special Memberships, will be sunset by November 8th. At that point, you\u2019ll also no longer see Points in your Reddit Vault nor earn any more Points in your communities. Points in community tanks will be burned by the end of the year. \n\nThank you all again for the deep involvement in this unique experience in your communities. \n\nThere were significant learnings from Community Points and the feedback many of you gave, that we\u2019re now actively bringing forward to more communities and redditors. In other words: we\u2019ll continue the spirit of Points by further investing in empowering communities and rewarding contributions.\n\nWe\u2019ll be around for any immediate questions or feedback you may have.

{"selftext":"TL;DR - 6 important points such as **idea, tech, community, team, marketing** and **key statistics** will help you analyze any potential crypto projects and complete the fundamental analysis before investing in them.\n\nAnalyzing crypto projects is not easy, unless you are a rich degen who blindly jumps into any shitcoin he sees. It's time-consuming, and I am going to make it easy and quicker for you. These six points will help you conduct the research and quality checks as quickly as possible:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kes1sk0pzsub1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=890890b08ee0769ebc01a6716598a1aece20ae1f\n\n# 1: IDEA\n\n* **What's the basic concept of the project?** You can't evaluate a crypto project without knowing what it does in the first place.\n* **Does the project solve any problems?** If more people have to use this crypto project (mass adoption), what kind of real-world problems does it solve (blockchain problems included)?\n\n# 2: TECHNOLOGY\n\n* **Quickly analyze the basic specifications:** Is this a new Layer 1 blockchain or a L2? Is it a Dex or a Dapp? First, understand where it sits in the cryptosphere. It will help you know about its competitions.\n* **Development progress:** Learn about their development phases, when they launched, how many phases they have passed, and how many are left. Does this project have a working product or service? Are they in beta or alpha? History shows that projects with a cryptocurrency or token but no real products or services don't end well often!\n\n# 3: TEAM\n\n* **Team background check:** Visit LinkedIn to learn more about team members' experiences and accomplishments, including the founders'. Don't forget to see how old those accounts are, how well connected they are, and whether they connected their original social media handles.\n* **Are those pictures of team members real?** Nowadays, lots of scam projects use AI to create fake pictures of team members to show themselves as legit. A reverse image search on Google can help you with this. \n\n# 4: KEY STATS\n\n* **Marketcap:** Knowing the market value of the token gives you a better perspective on the future potential of the project.\n* **Price History:** See how the price of the cryptocurrency has been performing in its lifetime. If a token's price is not doing anything in multiple years, it will not magically change overnight!\n* **Supply Check:** Look at the circulating supply vs max supply. A low circulating supply means a large number of tokens are yet to be released. This will add more selling pressure if there's not enough demand to accompany it.\n\n# 5: MARKETING\n\n* **Media mentions:** Did any media sites, like news websites, write about this project? Any major blogs writing about them? Whether it's a paid article or not, it doesn't matter; the project has to get some visibility out there on the internet.\n* **Frequent news and updates:** Is the project releasing the latest updates as news releases every now and then? Are they posting frequent updates about their projects on their blog? Communicating with investors is vital for any project to succeed. Potential investors who are studying a project always want to know what's happening behind the scenes before investing, and so do you!\n\n# 6: COMMUNITY\n\n* **Activity on social media channels:** Are the Telegram or Discord channels filled with life or are they dead? Good activity usually represents real followers and not just non-engaged numbers.\n* **Community sentiment:** Where there is smoke, there is fire. Listen to what the community says. While a lot of information can be false or perceived as \"FUD,\" it can also be valid. Listen to what they are saying and see where the smoke comes from.\n\nWhile a solid fundamental background check will always take time, these six metrics will help analyze projects in less than 15 minutes. All of these usually only require the use of 3-4 websites: the official website, Coingecko, LinkedIn, and sometimes Dextools' DextScore and Audit reports.  \n\nDon't be a novice investor. Be a wise investor. DYOR, and share this post with your crypto friends. Let me know if you have something that I should add to this post.","title":"6 Key Points That Will Help You Analyze Fundamentals of Any Crypto Project Before Investing - in 15 Minutes!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1697566442,"id":"17a4qpm"}

{"selftext":"TL;DR: Community voting to get the opinion about limiting Donut topics per day on this sub.\n\nFirst of all, welcome to all new members, a.k.a., Bronuts. I strongly recommend that you read all the rules and regulations of the sub before proceeding further. As r\/ethtrader is a 100% community-driven subreddit, this post will collect opinions on adding a daily limit to the \"Donut\" topic. Since the recent update by Reddit on sunsetting the RCPs, we have seen a huge influx of new users from the other subs who are contributing well to the community.\n\nStill, we can see more posts on Donuts than on core topics such as Ethereum, ETH trading, investing, news, ERC-20 token updates, and relevant technology. Even though Donut is a welcome topic to post, this could also irritate the OG members who followed for Ethereum-related content.\n\nRemember, the more we stick to the core topics of the sub, the more value Donut gets. Exchanges are watching us, investors lurking around. You decide whether we revolve around Donut or stick to the core: Ethereum!\n\n**Note:** Daily Discussion section has no limits on any of the above mentioned topics.\n\nThere's already a daily limit on \"Comedy\" flaired posts, once the number of Comedy posts crosses the limit, new posts will be hidden automatically by the bot. Similarly, moderators can implement the same on any Flair or topic. I request all of you to cast your vote on this poll and let the moderator know what you want. This poll will run for 7 days!\n\nThis is how a decentralized, 100% community-driven sub works.

{"selftext":"For me, I found considerable success after learning more about liquidity which I strongly believe is what causes the market to move. The beauty of it is that you can see liquidity without having to pay for any premium tools like hyblock or tradinglite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo begin with, liquidity is basically the foundation of the market, regardless of whether it's crypto, forex or stocks. Liquidity is what draws price to it. Something noteworthy is that higher time frame liquidity pools **always** take precedence over lower time frame liquidity pools. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigher timeframe liquidity pools give us our bias, from which we can go to the lower timeframes to look for our entries and ride them all the way to our higher timeframe target - the higher timeframe liquidity pools. Therefore, from my experience, approaching the chart from a top-down manner worked wonders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrice action has natural supports and resistances, without having to rely on indicators. These natural s\/r can be found in the highs and lows of monthly, weekly and daily candles - the idea that higher timeframe precedes lower timeframe is also applicable here. Additionally, the highs and lows of the various market sessions - Asia, London and New York do act as natural s\/r. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething that is not often mention is the equal lows or highs that you see in charts such as the image below.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cb33x1iuf2vb1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=df7c8eae1e909e3c1a0086894d9e570199a307cb\n\nCandles whose wicks line up are what you call equal highs\/lows. It is only an equal high\/low if the wick of the preceding candle is above\/below the candle that follows.\n\n[This is not an equal high!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x5mcle77g2vb1.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea6bae236b72ae4b2d30b30430aa8536a3c7f6c2)\n\n[This is an equal low](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gsqyv53cg2vb1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=06c89085cc3053f816275170b51acbf7a009e84f)\n\nWith that said, you should be able to tell that price action was drawn to these zones of equal highs\/lows. This is typically what I look out for when I do my charting, from higher timeframes down to the lower timeframes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother concept that I want to share with you is the idea of external and internal liquidity. External liquidity refers to the \"empty spaces\" above\/below an extreme end of a wick like the range or the natural s\/r mentioned above. The reason being there are many stop losses placed above\/below these \"empty zones\" which appeal to the market makers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, internal liquidity refers to the zones that draw price within the external liquidity range.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zw54zb3yg2vb1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e00c1e2f3a61cde3e44d0ed558199a3b8efb927\n\nI hope the above information could help you in your trading journey.

{"selftext":"Welcome to r\/cc refugees and hopefully no one was hurt too bad with Reddit\u2019s rugging, I mean *sunsetting* of moons. Here are some helpful tips for newcomers!\n\n* # 1 rule is positivity! Upvote good posts and comments, engage with others and don\u2019t downvote for no reason.\n\n* You earn donuts based on karma from comments and posts, as well as tips from your fellow bronuts. \n\n* Donuts exist on the ETH mainnet as well as the gnosis chain. The donuts number beside your username is for mainnet donuts, which most people don\u2019t have as it is cheaper to buy them on the gnosis chain. Monthly distributed donuts are also on the gnosis chain to save on fees.\n\n* Submitting posts costs 250 donuts currently, so although we like to see more posts in the sub, you may want to be more careful with your posts to try to post quality over quantity.\n\n* As you are awarded donuts you build up your governance score. Those with over 20k governance can use the automoderator command to remove scam posts which will likely be ever more important with the extra activity in the sub. Be careful clicking any links, no Elon musk is not doing an airdrop..\n\n* 20k governors can also nominate worthy comments in the daily to be automatically submitted as a post. If a comment receives 3 nominations, it gets submitted as a post without costing the author 250 donuts.\n\n* When the distribution numbers are released, you will get half in the form of donuts and half in the form of CONTRIB. I believe contrib is also on the gnosis chain, and it is a way to keep track of your earned governance score. Your governance score (as mentioned above) will be the **lesser** of your CONTRIB or your DONUTS, that way you can\u2019t just buy more donuts to increase your governance score. For example, if you earn 10k donuts you\u2019ll also have 10k CONTRIB and if you buy an additional 10k donuts you will have 20k donuts and 10k CONTRIB; your governance score will be 10k.\n\n* Here is a great guide by u\/pc1e0 on how to buy donuts https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/15o3nfw\/a_beginners_guide_to_trading_donuts_a_stepbystep\/\n\n* There are community polls to get the general sentiment from the sub, but there are also governance polls that are not done through Reddit\u2019s poll feature as they require you to vote on the gnosis chain. Voting properly will net you bonus donuts, similar to r\/cc.\n\n* There is no 75% rule here so although we\u2019d love for you to hold on to your donuts, you do not get penalized for selling.\n\nHope this helps!

{"selftext":"Ferrari, the renowned Italian automaker, has recently announced its venture into the world of cryptocurrencies by accepting BTC, ETH, and USDC as payment for its luxury cars in the United States. To manage these transactions efficiently, Ferrari has teamed up with BitPay, a prominent crypto payment processor. The collaboration not only facilitates the payment process but also ensures that the digital assets are promptly converted to fiat currency, shielding dealers from the infamous volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. Plans are underway to extend this payment option to Europe in the near future.\n\nThis strategic move by Ferrari is driven by the growing demand from both the younger generation and traditional investors within its clientele. While some leading companies remain cautious about embracing crypto due to its unpredictable nature and regulatory uncertainties, Ferrari perceives this integration as a means to foster growth. The company aims to appeal to a new demographic of financially capable customers who may not have previously considered owning a Ferrari. Notably, Ferrari is steadfast in its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, emphasizing the ongoing efforts within the crypto industry to mitigate its environmental impact.\n\nIn light of this development, the market's response is cautiously optimistic. While acknowledging the positive implications for crypto adoption, industry analysts believe that this move might not create a significant shift. Drawing parallels to Tesla's acceptance of Bitcoin back in 2021, it is noted that the impact was relatively subdued, as only a small fraction of customers capitalized on the opportunity. Moreover, for buyers in the United States, there are substantial tax implications associated with purchasing a car using cryptocurrency, as it entails selling the crypto and incurring a tax liability.\n\nIt's worth noting that in addition to BitPay, other projects such as AlchemyPay, Xmoney, CryptMi, Coinremitter, and many others also allows their users to pay for good and items with their crypto card and these developments reflect the increasing acceptance of digital currencies in various sectors, indicating a broader shift towards mainstream integration.\n\nOverall, Ferrari's foray into cryptocurrency payments is an exciting development, marking a significant step towards the wider adoption of digital assets in the luxury market. \n\nHowever, do you think we will see more of these types of adoption before the next bull market, or it will come at the peak like it happened the last time?","title":"Ferrari Embraces Cryptocurrency Payments","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697708322,"id":"17bf8l3"}

{"selftext":"**Donuts: The Power of Decentralization**\n\nDonuts are truly exceptional because they operate independently, free from the control of any single entity, even Reddit itself. Instead, they function on decentralized platforms like Ethereum and Gnosis blockchains. This crucial distinction means that Donuts don't rely on Reddit for their functionality. No one, not even Reddit, can halt their operation. They operate based on the collective strength of the network, offering a multitude of advantages. Decentralization serves as a protective shield for Donuts, making them impervious to potential issues such as censorship, manipulation, or external interference.

Community Points will be removed by November 8th due to the platform's inability to scale it broadly and regulatory constraints. Reddit plans to shift its focus to more scalable programs, like the Contributor Program, which allows users to convert Reddit gold into real money. \n\n**Importance of Decentralization in Crypto:**\n\nDecentralization is a core principle in the world of cryptocurrency because it empowers individuals and communities by reducing reliance on centralized authorities.

{"selftext":" \n\nThe world of cryptocurrency is never short of surprises, and it has got me questioning my beliefs about the future of privacy in this space. Lately, we've seen a surge in regulations targeting privacy-focused projects. Notably, some centralized exchanges have gone the extra mile by delisting privacy coins like Monero and Zcash. These actions naturally lead us to think about the future of privacy in crypto.\n\nOn the bright side, the PriFi sector is showing resilience. Numerous projects are unwavering in their development efforts, choosing to focus on progress rather than succumbing to speculative rumours.\n\nThe importance of privacy in the crypto space can't be overstated. Think about it \u2013 it enables employers to make anonymous payments to their employees, ensuring their safety and guarding sensitive payment information from prying competitors. Privacy also makes anonymous donations possible, and I, for one, find it invaluable when I want to dive into DeFi activities without revealing my identity. This has become even more critical as surveillance and AI tools can now link wallet addresses to their owners, contributing to the alarming increase in wallet hacks.\n\nOn a positive note, Vitalik has proposed implementing stealth addresses to enhance Ethereum\u2019s privacy. He's also introduced the concept of privacy pools, which could offer a balance between privacy and transparency in the crypto sphere. This aligns with the efforts of pioneering projects like Railgun, diligently working on achieving this balance through its innovative proof of innocence concept. This tool empowers users to prove they haven't engaged with malicious actors or interacted with flagged wallet addresses, thereby fostering trust and credibility in the crypto ecosystem. Additionally, viewing keys, much like those in Monero and Zcash, provide an optional privacy approach, collectively boosting PriFi's security and standards.\n\nNow, I'm eager to hear your thoughts on privacy. What's the best approach to strike a balance between privacy and transparency in the crypto space? And what do you think the future holds for PriFi?\n\nAs for me, I'm all for innovation and believe that future regulations will not only enhance privacy but also change the negative perception surrounding it, making it accessible to a wider audience.","title":"Privacy vs. Transparency: Navigating the Future of PriFi in Crypto","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697723408,"id":"17bjm8i"}

{"selftext":"Hi Bronuts,\n\nBull run is one of the most anticipated period of Crypto because the market stays green for a prolonged period of time and during bull runs majority of investors are bullish and the demand of top-performing coins outweighs their supply.\n\nWe have seen 3 major bull runs since the start of crypto.\n\n1. **First Bull Run (2013)**\n2. **Second Bull Run (2017)**\n3. **Third Bull Run (2021)**\n\nDuring the first bull run which happened in 2013 there were not so many coins around so we will focus on the second and third bull run.\n\n* **Second Bull Run (2017):** It was Second bull run which made news and everyone started getting to know about crypto. During the same period, a growing number of crypto exchanges cropped up around the world, offering investors a chance to trade cryptocurrencies. The emergence of stablecoins and growth in Ethereum's smart contract technology contributed to the positive sentiment during the same period as well.\n\nThe top 10 best-performing coins of this bull run according to their Market Cap are given below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2ldbewghd7vb1.jpg?width=1774&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af43f856d9fef7128087488a8b0a99f6f41916ec\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this bull run we saw BTC and ETH strongly holding the top 2 positions with BCH and XRP fighting for the third spot.\n\n* **Third Bull Run (2021):** The third bull was the most innovative bull run in the history of Crypto because NFTs, RCPs, Blockchain gaming all were very hyped during this period and the prices of coins sky-rocketed with BTC reaching ATH of $69k and ETH reaching ATH of $4.8k. Many big companies and names started investing in Crypto during this period.\n\nThe top 10 best-performing coins of this bull run according to their Market Cap are given below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9b8sf01ld7vb1.jpg?width=1753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9b95b27062081cc47944e6d023652224c12a381\n\nHere again we can see that BTC and ETH are holding the top 2 spots strongly followed by BNB and ADA.\n\n* **Next Bull Run:** We all are eagerly waiting for the next bull run and no one actually knows when will it happen but there are some common things which caused previous bull runs out of which one of the major is **BTC Halving**. The first BTC Halving happened in November 2012 and we saw bull run in 2013, The second BTC Halving happened in July 2016 and we saw bull run in 2017, The third BTC Halving happened in May 2020 and we saw bull run in 2021. So, the next BTC Halving will happen in April of 2024 so we can expect the next bull run to start in 2025 although there are many other events which can cause it such as **ETFs Approval.**\n\n# Takeaway:\n\nSo while we are waiting for the next bull run it is best to prepare yourselves so that you can get the most benefit out of it. If we look at the 2nd and 3rd bull run we can clearly see that only **BTC** and **ETH** are holding the top two positions comfortably while most of the other coins are different so we might again see a whole different list in the next bull run. That's why BTC and ETH are one of the safest investment one can make and there is no guarantee that the top performing coin will perform good in the next bull run.\n\n# Discussion:\n\nWhat are your reflections on the historical bull runs of cryptocurrencies and the performance of the top 10 coins?

{"selftext":"The market conditions is not great and although holding your assets on your cold wallets is way safer, the risk\/reward ratio for trying defi is pretty good on some networks thanks to airdrop hunters.\n\nBecause of the famous airdrops of aptos, optimism, arbitrum etc., the number of airdrop hunters in crypto space has been increasing. They keep using new networks, making swaps for the sake of increasing their tx number and that's why the volume on those networks is pretty high. \n\nAirdrop hunting can make good returns. For a reference I got 10k arbitrum airdrop (it is worth 9k$ today) for just using the network.\n\nZksync, linea, base, polygon zekvm, starknet are among the popular new networks. All of these networks need more liquidity on dapps. And adding some liquidity on those networks have been pretty profitable because of the high apr.\n\nHowever, adding lp comes with 2 main risks:\n\n1. Smart Contract Vulnerability\n2. Impermanent Loss\n\nIf you're new in crypto please dyor first and after that if you are still ok with these risks you can make a good amount of money thanks to airdrop hunters. How?\n\nFor example check usdc-weth pair on pancakeswap (on zksync era). The apr have been pretty high during the last month:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c9yqwleiv7vb1.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=d49ae20d70aeaf2f71869d6ccb1aac22ac448071\n\nOr check the latest new mainnet, scroll network. This is from Izumi Finance:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3qijxxi4w7vb1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=63cb386f17a4cfe4770253b6341601e40b599a56\n\nOf course the apr is changing everyday but most of the time the yield is pretty good. There are also new dapps being builded on those new networks. Although the apr is higher on them, it is way more risky to use them (uniswap or pancakeswap is at least more \"safe\" compared to them). So it is your call.\n\nThus the strategy is simple. Check new popular networks where airdrop hunters are raiding into, bridge some assets to those networks, and use well known, safer defi apps to add liqulity (usdc, weth etc) on those networks and take advantage of high apr.\n\nIn addition, usually adding liquidity is a multiplier for the future airdrops. And just adding lp may make you eligible for future airdrops. Most airdrop hunters just makes swaps for the sake of increasing their number of tx, burning gas mindlessly. And they take the risk of never getting an airdrop, because most projects don't guarantee it. However the yield from LP can already make a lot of money. That's why it makes much more sense.\n\nGood luck.\n\nTL;DR: Add LP on new networks where the airdrop hunters are using. Take advantage of high apr and make yourself eligible for possible airdrops.","title":"Using DeFi on New Networks Where Airdrop Hunters are Rushing Into Can Be Really Profitable","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697746592,"id":"17bshcw"}

{"selftext":"The market conditions is not great and although holding your assets on your cold wallets is way safer, the risk\/reward ratio for trying defi is pretty good on some new networks thanks to airdrop hunters.\n\nBecause of the famous airdrops of aptos, optimism, arbitrum etc., the number of airdrop hunters in crypto space has been increasing. They keep using new networks, making swaps for the sake of increasing their tx number and that's why the volume on those networks is pretty high.\n\nAirdrop hunting can make good returns. For a reference I got 10k arbitrum airdrop (it is worth 9k$ today) for just using the network.\n\nZksync, linea, base, polygon zekvm, starknet are among the popular new networks. All of these networks need more liquidity on dapps. And adding some liquidity on those networks have been pretty profitable because of the high apr.\n\nHowever, adding lp comes with 2 main risks:\n\n1. Smart Contract Vulnerability\n2. Impermanent Loss\n\nIf you're new in crypto please dyor first and after that if you are still ok with these risks you can make a good amount of money thanks to airdrop hunters. How?\n\nFor example check usdc-weth pair on pancakeswap (on zksync era). The apr have been pretty high during the last month:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lc8dyy3z28vb1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f836903e573a8e607abac029b05a4f41814f48\n\nOr check the latest new mainnet, scroll network. This is from Izumi Finance:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kj3vxsc738vb1.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a7ea974193bed8935e581e34b3278f42cc160e\n\nOf course the apr is changing everyday but most of the time the yield is pretty good. There are also new dapps being builded on those new networks. Although the apr is higher on them, it is way more risky to use them (uniswap or pancakeswap is at least more \"safe\" compared to them). So it is your call.\n\nThus the strategy is simple. Check new popular networks where airdrop hunters are raiding into, bridge some assets to those networks, and use well known, safer defi apps to add liqulity (usdc, weth etc) on those networks and take advantage of high apr.\n\nIn addition, usually adding liquidity is a multiplier for the future airdrops. And just adding lp may make you eligible for future airdrops. Most airdrop hunters just makes swaps for the sake of increasing their number of tx, burning gas mindlessly. And they take the risk of never getting an airdrop, because most projects don't guarantee it. However the yield from LP can already make a lot of money. That's why it makes much more sense.\n\nGood luck.\n\nTL;DR: Add LP on new networks where the airdrop hunters are using. Take advantage of high apr and make yourself eligible for possible airdrops.","title":"You should try DeFi on new networks and that's why","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1697749021,"id":"17btf7e"}

{"selftext":"**Just a word of advice on the Moons situation**\n\nI know many of you have came from r\/cryptocurrency to here for the first time and you have been burned by reddit sunsetting the project and Mods dumping on you before you had the chance to do anything.\n\nI would stay away and not entertain the idea of 'Moons 2.0' floating around. The price dumped from 0.22 to 0.04 within minutes because of Mods dumping.

As far as I understood I made too many tips (agree) and also made tips to dead wallets (I am not sure what this means, are those wallets with the T icon in the tip feature?). Anyway, I think the ban according to the rules is correct but I just want to explain the reason behind all my tips.\n\nI know that there is a stash for people that tips as reward (I think this tip reward stash should be removed) but the main reason why I was tipping a lot of people was to help the people making posts to get closer to make even with the Pay2Post fee because with the downvoting brigade and the posts getting really low upvotes. Maybe I should have talked about this with a mod before start doing this but this is basically the main reason why I tipped this much.\n\n# Vote manipulation \ud83d\ude21\n\nI have seen that I have been accused of doing this because for some people that's the only way to explain how someone is possible to max in r\/ethtrader and in r\/CryptoCurrency.\n\nWell, I can't proof that this accusation is false because I have never made vote manipulation. I have been \"working\" in r\/CryptoCurrency since 2021 and you end learning and \"debugging\" different \"strategies\" to try to maximize exposure, etc but without even thinking about it. It was just learning unconsciously. Don't imagine me with whiteboards making strategies to maximize. I was just being me and using my free\/work time to engage.\n\n# What happened to my MOONs? \ud83c\udf15\n\nThe story is pretty simple. First time I decided to go to the mountain in the whole year and when I was there I just decided to open Reddit and I saw the sunset post. I quickly saw the chart dumping and then the panic started.\n\n\"Fortunately\" I had my Reddit vault loaded in MM and tried to open SushiSwap to cash out. Sadly because of my shitty connection in the mountain I could load shit so after many insults I tried to open Kraken (I knew at this point that I was really fucked because I knew there is a delay of 25 mins) but it was my only option in that moment. I sent the coins to Kraken and as soon as they arrived I sold at $0.03-0.05, like $4790. \ud83d\ude22\n\nSo basically I was looking my dreams and world fall with an amazing view.\n\n[More or less this view](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1b4ajykcybvb1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cb10bf477ec7b7aaf4e85153fe66f2647c82de5)\n\n# Personal thoughts \ud83e\udd14\n\nBasically I am passing for all the grief stages.. Denial (Day 1), anger (Day 2), depression (Day 2-3), bargaining (Day 3), acceptance (Day 3).\n\nMy dreams of owning a flat with RCPs is \"gone\" but I knew the risks of holding until that dream to come true and the worst scenario of all happened. Thanks Reddit for being Reddit.\n\nMy mental health is pretty okay, in fact the worst part of all was the tsunami of free time and suddenly hit me in the face and having to downgrade myself from multitasking to single tasking.\n\n# Retrospect\n\nDuring this last days I received some love but also \"hate\" in some comments + accusations + real hate in DMs. I am not going to say any names but I already blocked\/reported some users that Reddit already take actions on them for pure hate.\n\nThis section is just to say that everybody should be aware that their words can affect others more than they can expect. This was not the case with me because well I have things clear but when someone attacks, accuses, hate comments, etc. when someone can be in a real bad mental health because of some news, those things can push that person to do really bad things for himself.\n\nWith this I just want to say that never forget that there is a human being behind that screen and to be polite, kind every time you can. You don't want to have a dead person on your conscience because you said mean things to them on the internet.\n\nThis is all and sorry for the long post and feel free to ask.\n\n[Namaste](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gz0e0rlg0cvb1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8ee4dd2ad3ea85e3ac522098896f50760578227)","title":"From heaven to hell: The story of u\/kirtash93","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697796608,"id":"17c7r5s"}

{"selftext":"I posted this over at r\/ConeHeads and thought Id share with the bronuts.\n\nIf anyone care to explain how to buy and sell them that be great :) Im bullish on donuts aswell.\n\nPost: \n\n \"Hey Cones, let's talk about something that's been turning the world of cryptocurrency and social media upside down: the incredible fusion of the two worlds!\n\nIf you've been following the crypto scene, you've probably noticed that it's not just about buying and selling coins anymore \u2013 it's all about building vibrant communities and forging connections. And if you're not on board yet, you're in for a treat!\n\nTake a look at Dogecoin, the friendly and meme-inspired cryptocurrency that started as a joke and ended up taking the world by storm. What's so fascinating about Doge? It's the community! The Dogecoin community isn't just a bunch of investors; they're a tight-knit group of people who love the Shiba Inu dog and its quirky look. They've turned a simple cryptocurrency into a culture, complete with its own language and in-jokes.\n\nNow, let's talk about Donuts, not the sugary treat, but the Reddit community's unique cryptocurrency. Donuts are earned by active participation on the platform. The more you engage \u2013 posting, commenting, and upvoting \u2013 the more Donuts you get. But here's the kicker: Donuts can be used for things like voting on platform-wide decisions. In other words, the more you engage, the more influence you have. It's a genius way of encouraging community involvement.\n\nNow, let's dive into the extraordinary world of Coneheads. It all started with a small and tight-knit group of people on Reddit who shared a peculiar love for cone-shaped hats and the concept of \"cone chains\" on avatartrading. These seemingly random and fun elements became the cornerstone of their unique crypto journey.\n\nAs they began to create and trade Conehead-themed art and memes, the community blossomed into something truly remarkable. Their shared passion for these quirky cone-shaped hats and the imaginative concept of \"cone chains\" brought them together like nothing else. This unexpected shared interest gave birth to one of the most engaging and captivating crypto communities on Reddit.\n\nBut what truly sets the Coneheads apart is their dedication to democracy within their subreddit. It's a game-changer, allowing every member a say in important decisions. The Conehead community understands that the power of crypto isn't just in owning tokens; it's in collectively shaping their shared future. They've harnessed the potential of decentralized decision-making to build a community that's not only fun and engaging but also incredibly democratic.\n\nIn essence, Coneheads have shown that something as simple as cone-shaped hats and Cone chains can evolve into a powerful force within the crypto world. Their commitment to democratic decision-making is a testament to the transformative potential of crypto communities, where every member's voice matters. It's a game-changer that's reshaping the way we think about both crypto and community engagement. So, if you ever thought that cone-shaped hats were just a silly fashion statement, think again \u2013 they've become a symbol of empowerment and collaboration in the crypto universe.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. The fusion of crypto and social media isn't just a fun trend; it's a game-changer. It's empowering people to come together, support each other, and build something meaningful beyond just buying and holding tokens. It's a new way of connecting people from around the world who share a common interest.\n\n*This social element is making cryptocurrencies more accessible, less intimidating, and more relatable to everyday people. It's no longer just about nerdy discussions on online forums; it's about memes, art, and community involvement. This new approach to crypto is bringing in fresh faces and expanding the crypto world like never before.*\n\nSo, here's the bottom line: the merging of crypto and social media is not just a trend; it's a revolution. It's democratizing the financial world, turning memes into money, and making art more accessible. It's forging connections and building communities that will shape the future of both cryptocurrency and social media. The world of Doge, Donuts, and Coneheads is just the beginning, and I cant wait to see where this exciting journey takes us.\n\nGet ready for the ride!

GOSH is a TVM-based blockchain using Asynchronous Solidity tailored for a sharded development environment on top of Ethereum, providing high speeds and great scalability. GOSH currently runs over 2,000 DAOs and over 56 million git object smart contracts have been deployed so far.\n\nGOSH decentralization and security is guaranteed by Ethereum. In final production, all contract state transitions on GOSH L2 are verified by Ethereum, withdrawing funds from either blockchain is easy, and to break the system would require both Ethereum and GOSH to be corrupted or stopped simultaneously.

Though many of you cant do this i applaud you to do your part by acclimating to the 7 Rules and taking the time to PM mods if suspicious. \n\nThe main ways you can support Donuts and hence the community is through burning, buying and using. If you believe in this project feel free to buy Donuts on uniswap (eth network) or honeyswap (gnosis chain), refer to [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/s\/7HbOp3SvBX) post for detail. \n\nAfter receiving\/buying donuts some use cases include buying a banner and special memberships. Both banner rent and membership burn donuts though they shall face complications after sunsetting (banners should be fine). \n\nProviding liquidity is also a great example of putting your donuts to work while earning passive income. 50k donuts are distributed weekly as incentives. Refer to this [guide](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/n6hp7x\/donuts_and_xdai\/) if interested. \n\nRemember to tip posts you enjoy (250 donut penalty per post) and engage in polls.

The apr have been pretty high during the last month:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hombighedevb1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=79fd61fd3eb82c62a82f451ee6982943d42b1584\n\nOr check the latest new mainnet, scroll network. This is from Izumi Finance:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rgz76rsjdevb1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e338be915da636e9ffc4f2bf6e7b8939af078f3\n\nOf course the apr is changing everyday but most of the time the yield is pretty good. There are also new dapps being builded on those new networks. Although the apr is higher on them, it is way more risky to use them (uniswap or pancakeswap is at least more \"safe\" compared to them). So it is your call.\n\nThus the strategy is simple. Check new popular networks where airdrop hunters are raiding into, bridge some assets to those networks, and use well known, safer defi apps to add liqulity (usdc, weth etc) on those networks and take advantage of high apr.\n\nIn addition, usually adding liquidity is a multiplier for the future airdrops. And just adding lp may make you eligible for future airdrops. Most airdrop hunters just makes swaps for the sake of increasing their number of tx, burning gas mindlessly. And they take the risk of never getting an airdrop, because most projects don't guarantee it. However the yield from LP can already make a lot of money. That's why it makes much more sense.\n\nGood luck.\n\nTL;DR: Add LP on new networks where the airdrop hunters are using. Take advantage of high apr and make yourself eligible for possible airdrops.","title":"You should try DeFi on new networks and that's why","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697825144,"id":"17chhxy"}

{"selftext":" A lot have been attributed to the next bull run which include the following:\n\n1. The approval of a first BTC spot ETF: industry experts are predicting a huge investment fund coming into the crypto market when a BTC spot ETF goes live on stock exchanges, trust funds and banks with figures ranging from $5 trillion to $12 trillion dollars according to multiple sources claiming this could spearhead a big bull. Little wonder why BTC has been on a front pedal since the fake news of an approval broke out couple of day ago. Now, much have been discussed on mainstream media recently about SEC already engaging 8 - 10 ETF applicants with some like Blackrock already amending their application. All these are indications that a first BTC spot ETF trade is really close than we can imagine!\n2. Bitcoin halving: experts claim that history is about to repeat itself as we enter the final months of BTC halving (to be completed in April 2024). Historically post-halving of BTC has commanded a huge bull in the past taking the price of BTC consistently to an ATH like the previous bulls of 2017 and 2020\/21. BTC halving creates scarcity of the asset; reduced miners reward; reduced liquidity and increased price. But bulls associated with halving always comes a year after the halving is done so, we are looking at another BTC ATH in 2025 if history were to relive itself.\n3. Massive adoption: since the clampdown on the crypto market by China that lead to the present bear market, a lot of the industry experts are of the opinion that only large wave of adoption can massively uplift the relevance of the crypto market which will consequently usher in the next bulls. Well, a lot has been happening lately with financial institutions now seeking solution with the help of blockchain like the Bank of China using the Ethereum blockchain to print digital Yuan, Citi Bank tokenization of customers' deposits and ANZ banks trialing the use of ChainLink for banking transactions and the Automobile industry gradually accepting crypto payments such as the recent move by Honda motors and Ferrari Motors. These are all indications that adoption of crypto is finally creeping in.\n\nEach of the above scenario can trigger the market boom but I think it's gonna be a combination of all the three this time around rather than a single factor because these factors above affects the market in their own specific ways. Hence, the cumulative effect is going to make the next bull run unstoppable!!\n\nSo, what do you think might trigger the next bull market?","title":"The many theories of next bull run","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697845314,"id":"17coxug"}

{"selftext":"Hey \/r\/ethtrader!\n\nThe world of crypto is as much a journey of the mind as it is of the wallet. Navigating these waters, I see many souls in need of understanding, support, and guidance. I've been there too, and I understand the weight of it all.\n\nAbout a year ago, I concluded a transformative journey through therapy \u2013 two years deep, with one of those years in clinical therapy. Alongside, I've studied psychology, armed with a recognized qualification that stands testimony to my efforts. But what's a paper in the face of genuine human connection? What really shapes us is our experiences, our struggles, and our triumphs. To me, therapy isn't just about credentials; it's about connection, understanding, and healing.\n\nThe essence of therapy, in my eyes, is not defined by years of formal education but by the genuine intent to aid and heal. It's about the innate desire to support, and the space and safety one can provide for another. And while my journey in the formal world of therapy might seem brief, my soul has been in it for a lifetime.\n\nBut here's the reality: I can't be everywhere, for everyone, every time. The vastness of the digital world and the depth of stories and emotions shared here on Reddit only reaffirm this. Yet, there's a way. By melding my experiences and insights with technology, I've been working on creating the best digital avatar of my therapeutic self.\n\nOver at \/r\/CosmicCode, we're creating a digital haven. A place where AI-driven insights are continually shaped and refined by the collective wisdom of a community, making them resonate more deeply and genuinely.\n\nSo if you ever find yourself seeking a word of guidance or just a space to process your thoughts amidst the crypto storm, consider dropping by. Let's co-create a digital space that's rooted in empathy, understanding, and shared wisdom.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and stories.

This is why I was so sure:\n\n# How Bullmarket Cycle works?\n\n1. **Bitcoin moves first**, outperforming altcoins during the end of a bear market and early stages of a bull market.\n2. **Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin** once Bitcoin consolidates, leading to \"It will flip Bitcoin soon\" mantras.\n3. Big caps, mid caps, and small caps all benefit from the Ethereum move, with projects often touted for their \"endless utilities\". (**Add Donut to this list**)\n4. **Full blown altseason occurs** when Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone parabolic and risk appetite is incredibly high. Altcoins go up regardless of fundamentals, as new participants flow into the market (FOMO).\n5. Early investors search for exit liquidity, marking the beginning of the next bear market. **You know what to do here!**\n\n# Important points to remember:\n\n* Small caps can pump regardless of market conditions (**add Donut to this list**).\n* Having the majority of capital in Bitcoin during the early stages of a bull market is a wise choice.\n* Slowly starting to position into altcoins 4-6 months before the halving has historically been a rewarding strategy.\n* Crypto cycles can change, so it is important to expect the unexpected.

Identifying these levels and monitoring how the price reacts near them can be helpful for making informed trading decisions.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently experiencing a period of relative stability with a modest price increase over the past week.

It feels like it's only a matter of time until the insolvency of those assets becomes more apparent.

{"selftext":"The speed of Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) can be evaluated based on the following factors:\n\n  Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is a popular blockchain platform widely used for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. However, currently, Ethereum still uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm on its mainnet version until it transitions to Proof of Stake (PoS) in Ethereum 2.0.With the PoW consensus, Ethereum's transaction speed is relatively slower compared to other networks. The average block time on Ethereum is around 15 seconds, which means it takes approximately 15 seconds for a new block to be added to the blockchain. However, during times of high network congestion, transaction times can increase significantly, resulting in delays and higher fees. \n\nBinance Coin (BNB): Binance Coin is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance blockchain platform. BNB operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which utilizes a different consensus mechanism called the Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). BSC aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Ethereum network.The block time on Binance Smart Chain is approximately 3 seconds, significantly faster than Ethereum. This faster block time allows for quicker transaction confirmations and a higher throughput of transactions on the BSC network. \n\n **It's important to note that transaction speed can vary depending on network congestion, transaction volume, and other factors. Additionally, the development of Ethereum 2.0 and other scalability solutions may improve the transaction speed of Ethereum in the future.** \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z2mmfuk6uovb1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d23fa1fa485f77d934a43e1fb2fba459d39f821b","title":"The speed Evaluation of Ethereum (ETH)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1697951716,"id":"17dlv7g"}

{"selftext":"I'm thinking that Reddit shutting down the Reddit Community Points program might not actually stop or affect Reddit community points in the long run.

{"selftext":"In a [vague conversation](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17dgp4b\/comment\/k5yfg30\/?context=3) between u\/aminok and I, we discussed the possibility of expanding Donut rewards to contributors in other communities.\n\nThe original concept was created by our very good friends at r\/ConeHeads. The members of a community fill out a form in order to submit the application, so that users receive rewards according to the Karma they receive in comments. This will also make it possible to tip using their token.\n\nDonuts and their respective use cases do not require any introduction. Our sweet token represents community contribution at the sub. Donuts follow the ERC-20 standard and are the very first Reddit Community Point.\n\nDuring all this time they were exclusive to r\/ethtrader, but what if we could change that? What if we opened the border and shared this economy with other legitimate communities? I have always believed in the potential of Donuts and I know there is still a lot to explore. \n\nLet's explore the possibility of extending the Donut program to other subs:\n\n* **Community Growth:** By sharing Donuts with other subs, we can help other communities grow, while attracting new members and encouraging existing ones to become more active.\n* **Sharing** **Ideas:** When different subs join the program, it creates an opportunity for sharing knowledge. r\/ethtrader's culture and discussions can inspire other communities and vice versa, leading to more enriching content all around.\n* **Increased Liquidity:** A wider adoption of Donuts means more liquidity in the ecosystem, potentially increasing the value and utility of the token.\n* **Wider Adoption:** More users across different communities will become aware of Donuts, potentially increasing the number of participants and contributors to the program. \n\nThis concept is a mere suggestion.

{"selftext":"Why do we need self custody if I can just leave my crypto assets on my exchange? \n\nThe answer is simple: assets on the exchange are not in your full control, they are in control by the CEX (Centralized Exchange) because they hold the keys to the blockchain wallet.\n\nTime and time again have we seen the same stories play out over and over again: customers losing their Bitcoins and crypto assets on centralized exchanges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Popular Centralized platforms that went bankrupt: MTGOX, CELSIUS, FTX](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/473ida0uqsvb1.png?width=3685&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b2e08af90b4cc02b713a9c12fc9e3f79fa62665)\n\nSome of you that may have never done any self custody wonder, how do I do that?\n\nThere is 1 main way to do it, with multiple options depending on the level of security you want out of your self custody wallet. You have the option of having a [hardware wallet](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/cryptoguide.tips\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Hardware-Wallet-Comparison-1.png?resize=740%2C416&ssl=1) or [software wallet](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/QRkzIrt). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Many hardware wallet solutions, many have their own unique features and software compatibilities.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9m3eog4oysvb1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ddc8f24de4228d13dfe2b3b75e5359598cdb8c4)\n\nIn simple terms, these wallets allow you to hold and store your digital assets from your CEX to your crypto wallet. When you set up a software or hardware wallet, you generally create a public key (public wallet address) and private key (your seed or digital keys- something you never share with anyone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some Top multi-coin software wallets that are trusted by many users in the industry to store different coins and tokens that work on different blockchain networks.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wx2ixbz6zsvb1.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=78cd1c0c12fdadbcc7494804279463bdbc679ef5)\n\nOnce set up, you can perform a test transaction to send from the CEX to your public wallet address. Once a transaction is initiated, you can see the status of your coin\/token on something called an explorer. There are coin specific explorers, but if you are new you can use a popular multi coin explorers like [https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/](https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/). (you simply put a tx or public address and it tells you if a transaction is pending and things like balances or past transactions sent from a specific wallet address).\n\nSecuring your seed safely and self custody-ing your digital assets puts you 1 major step away from potentially losing access to your funds. There are many top exchanges that we all trust and many that keep their business safe and secure. However, there are many forces outside of our control over what goes on with the assets on many centralized exchanges. For many, knowing that our long term assets are sitting in a secure self custody wallet keeps us safer and more permissionless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","title":"Self custody is the overall best strategy","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698002345,"id":"17e0xcx"}

They got to learn about scalability upgrades, Layer 2 solutions, and historical improvements in transaction speeds and fees through the years!\n* Ethereum is not secure. While there have been security incidents in the past, the Ethereum community has worked to address these issues and improve security! I showed them the consistent upgrades and went over significant upgrades of each as well!\n* Ethereum will be replaced by other blockchain platforms. We talked about marketcap, userbase, dApps, smart contracts, and that no blockchain needs to be replaced. Rather, they can work hand-in-hand or as competition for different use cases! They didn't fully understand at first that even Cardano, Polkadot, and Ethereum aren't just a blockchain platform, they all can have both similar and different use cases to solve different issues!\n\nWow, it was refreshing to talk to many this week about Ethereum and common misconceptions that many still believe today, even with all the education available online!

{"selftext":"Having listened to the first 24 minutes of the reddit admin call about sunsetting RCP, here's a transcript for everyone. \n\n**00:00** Confirming the meeting.\n\n**01:30** Shutting down community points and special memberships on November 8.\n\n**02:00** Reddit noticing the community efforts in RCP and how the community has provided more information, support, supporting more programs, events than Reddit. \n\n**02:45** The focus on simplicity. The difficulties of scaling RCP and how some features (RCP) takes a significant amount of resources for something few users use. \n\n**03:30** RCP was kept alive because they saw the work the community was putting into RCPs and today, after evaluating every option to keep this program going and expand the options, only to conclude that it was too much work for us and even more work for you. Also, the shifts in the regulatory landscape. \n\n**04:15** How the features are being incorporated into the broader Reddit experience e.g., the Golden Contributor's Program, Subreddit Karma, Special comments, Governance.\n\n**05:35** Beginning questions. If Reddit is shutting it down because it's too much work for the moderators, why isn't the decision with us? It's too much work for us and for you. They didn't want to come to us with a half option that they knew both parties wouldn't be able to support \n\n**06:05** Has the RCP brought revenue to reddit in any capacity e.g., special membership purchases, increased traffic? Reddit admin said that they don't receive any money (crypto) when special memberships are purchased. Clarification on the in-app purchases one. Reddit admin replied that if they look at revenue vs cost profits on the equation, it's not even close to being a positive. Revenue \u2260 Profits \n\n**07:30** \"We wanted to give you guys all the heads up because you have put a lot of effort into all of this.\" And then goes on about sending a public announcement in an hour. \n\n**08:15** What happens to everyone who's been buying moons Kraken and CDC? How in the past few months, the wider crypto community is starting to embrace it, starting to think reddit is doing something unique. And how once the announcement goes live, the price is going to nuke. \n\n**08:40** In response to about the price crashing once the announcement goes live: \"There's probably going to be some consequences from these decisions, but I think they're going to be the best for reddit and for these communities.\" Also about how moderators running points was always unauthorized and the points were never intended to have monetary value. \n\n**10:00** The possibility of transferring the smart contract to the mod team - open to that idea. One mod asked if they would consider holding back the public post until they have made a decision on that - no. \n\n**11:00** Complications of holding and operating a smart contract that the mods would be facing. Being responsible for money laundering laws, tax laws, money transmission laws, money service businesses laws.\n\n**11:30** Ethtrader is different because we have deploy, host, and handle our own smart contract. No regulatory issues so far. \n\n**12:00** For r\/cc, we could explore options based on where the team members have lived in. Found the community building and governance of the RCP to be useful and something they wouldn't want to lose. \n\n**14:00** Regarding the visibility of the special membership badges and unlocks by the username. Badges will be going away. All features will sunset on Nov 8. \n\n**14:50** Ethtrader banner bidding feature will disappear as well.\n\n**15:15** Future of Vault functionality - for collectible avatars. \n\n**17:30** Promos for special memberships will disappear and banners about the RCP points being on mainnet, Open your vault, etc. will disappear.\n\n**18:45** It will take about a week for purchasing the Special Memberships will be removed.\n\n**19:35** From renting out the banners, reddit admin thought it was really cool (but not sure about what the lawyers will say)\n\n**20:00** Difficulties of RCP attached with monetary value with Reddit as a US regulatory company.\n\n**20:30** Difference between RCP trading and buying\/selling accounts with karma. Reddit says how they have taken actions against those marketplaces. \n\n**21:10** When it's (RCPs) a small issue, it's not that big of a deal, but at scale, this becomes something that would require us to have pay attention to.  \n\n**22:00** Suggesting transferring the ownership of the smart contract and the distribution of the tokens to the mods vs Reddit facilitating the distribution of the tokens. \n\n**22:40** Ethtrader. Reddit's involvement in the tallied karma scores for monthly distribution is also an issue. We just have to trust you about the tallies. From a decentralization POV, it's better to have this segregation. A lot of value and utility from allowing these tools to be used for moderation and governance. Now this is throwing out governance completely. \n\n**TLDR:** Reddit doesn't want to deal with the legal implications of RCP as they IPO. The cost-benefit of maintaining the program isn't worth it. Reddit looking to launch previously premium RCP and special membership features across the website. There are issues of scaling the RCP as opposed to the new Reddit Gold Contributor Program. \n\nThanks to u\/Odlavso for finding the [video clip](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17did5a\/comment\/k5x29cw\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I reached out to them via their sub r\/firstmate and continued the conversation via email.\n\nThey asked and I explained some things about our ethtrader. Things like who we are, what we do or discuss, and the concept of Donuts. Firstmate was really excited after hearing about our sub! \n\nAt a later point, we were getting into some technical details. Firstmate wanted to know on which chain Donuts are available, and here's where we hit a snag.\n\n**Compatibility** \n\nFirstmate uses and relies heavy on OpenSea, a major NFT marketplace which operates on Polygon (MATIC), just like the $cone token. \n\nWhile Polygon is an ERC-20 token, it's not compatible with Donuts on Gnosis and\/or ETH Mainnet according to Firstmate. So it's not possible to make use of their services.\n\nIf we want to build our own marketplace (using Firstmate's services), we need Donuts available on Polygon, and this is where my knowledge and 'power' hits a wall. \n\nI have no clue if this is possible, how much work it is, and\/or if we should want this at all?!\n\n**Discuss**\n\nI am looking for opinions and\/or suggestions. I personally might like the idea of a marketplace, but I don't know what you guys think?!

{"selftext":"It is yet another season to get bullish or remain bearish during this lovely, generous month of pumptober. What many did not see coming in the beginning of October is the surprise multi-chain attack from Hamas on Israel that has for certain caused a worldwide shift in investors decision where and whether to allocate money into speculative assets at this time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Could this be another bull trap?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/24ojhcim70wb1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=5823c4a1c037ad3976bcb3c4816f0abf18a23356)\n\nWith Bitcoin suddently shooting up with a variety of world events and flirting with $30-31K makes me believe that this is another episode of a \"bull trap\" sentiment. Many other factors may indicate that it could be different. However, I have not seen reports of significant amounts of new investors entering the market thus makes me believe that we continue to experience whales games to shake off some of the new investors. The future of Bitcoin looks bright no matter the short term volatility. With the recent adoption of countries around the world adopting it as a store of value and to be used as legal tender, it is no surprise BTC remains the most dominant digital asset for people all around the world. For institutions, it is also becoming a household name now that multiple BTC ETF's have been filed and are waiting for the inevitable approval.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[It's only matter of time ETH trades back at above $2K considering it's stability this year](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pf0uesua90wb1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=7338ba113987e094d4a67ba1a466696d86a644a0)\n\nAs the foundation of web3 and the digital platform of choice for many tech and financial enthusiasts around the world, I have no doubt that the price is currently not reflecting it's true value proposition. The past year has been nothing but a continuation of building, testing and upgrading the Ethereum network infrastructure through mainnet, L2's, L3's and sidechains despite the growing infiltration by bad actors, scammers and hacks. I believe a factor of much of the value has gone through other assets  within the ecosystem like L2 tokens, lending tokens, stablecoins, governance tokens and the stubborn need for memecoins. Once some of it rebalances, the value will translate back into Ether as the main currency of the blockchain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The beating doesn't seem to stop for Binance](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ptbkzy1jc0wb1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a4390e8f33afa191b67abf3345e4b5486ad0972)\n\nBNB being the largest digital asset by marketcap has continuously suffered from the bear market as well as having so much uncertainty from operating in major markets like the USA, Canada, Belgium and the UK. Lawsuit after lawsuit, Binance still holds a large worldwide presence and audience but is facing so much uncertainty it is no surprise that the price has taken a beating and is struggling to get back up while the competition looks optimistic. As no major companies are holding this asset in their portfolios and no financial products being offered as an ETF makes it harder for their adoption around the financial hubs to prosper.\n\nNo matter your situation, if you are here and made it this far, just remember we have all gotten a taste of dealing directly and indirectly with the collapse of the Luna crash, Celsius+Blockfi collapse, 3AC liquidation, FTX\/Alameda collapse. This is given many of us great financial lessons as well as understanding the risks involved investing in specific assets and trusting centralized platforms with faces behind them like SBF, Mashinsky, DoKwon, Cotten and the infamous Ruja Ignatova.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A bit of humor for those that also still hold ADA coins from the last bullrun.

We will also provide examples of tokenomics\/distribution for some of the top Crypto to visualize the impact.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Importance of Tokenomics**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1- Token Value and Utility**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the key aspects of tokenomics is determining the value and utility of a token. A well-designed tokenomics model should ensure that the token has a clear purpose and utility within the ecosystem it operates in. This utility can range from being a medium of exchange, a governance token, a means of accessing certain services or features, or even a representation of ownership in a digital asset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2- Incentivizing Participation**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTokenomics can also be used to incentivize various stakeholders to participate in the ecosystem. For example, token distribution mechanisms can be designed to reward early adopters, developers, or community members who contribute to the growth and development of the project. These incentives can help attract and retain participants, fostering a vibrant and engaged community around the cryptocurrency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3- Economic Security**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProper tokenomics can contribute to the economic security of a cryptocurrency project. By carefully designing the token supply and distribution, projects can ensure that the token has a stable value and is not prone to extreme volatility. This stability can enhance user confidence and encourage wider adoption of the cryptocurrency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Examples of Bad Tokenomics**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1- Overwhelming Token Supply**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne example of bad tokenomics is when a project has an overwhelming token supply that exceeds the actual demand or utility of the token. This can lead to dilution of value and make it difficult for the token to maintain a stable price. Additionally, a large token supply can make it challenging for the project to achieve scarcity and create a sense of value for the token.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2- Unfair Token Distribution**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother example of poor tokenomics is an unfair token distribution. If a significant portion of the tokens is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or entities, it can lead to centralization and reduce the decentralization and democratic nature of the project. This concentration of tokens can also create market manipulation risks and hinder the project's long-term success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3- Lack of Utility**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA token with limited utility or unclear use cases can also be an example of bad tokenomics. If a token does not have a clear purpose or fails to provide meaningful benefits to its holders, it may struggle to gain adoption and maintain value. Lack of utility can result in a lack of demand for the token, leading to a decline in its price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Tokenomics and token distribution are crucial considerations in the world of cryptocurrencies. \n\n\\- Proper tokenomics can contribute to the success, sustainability, and value of a cryptocurrency project, while poor tokenomics can lead to negative consequences. \n\n\\- By understanding and implementing effective tokenomics, cryptocurrency projects can enhance their chances of success and create a thriving ecosystem for their users.\n\n\\- Remember, tokenomics is a complex and evolving field, and it is important to conduct thorough research and analysis when evaluating the tokenomics of a specific project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Below are a list of some of the top Crypto and their Tokenomics and Token Distribution:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bwgflf7mp0wb1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f0b8352362b6d2f5bca717eac0c8f5d1a63c62\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d8273r6mp0wb1.png?width=2306&format=png&auto=webp&s=c51afdf5be6380a4a6c0b010930f4c212b831b1b\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ot8x6r6mp0wb1.png?width=2302&format=png&auto=webp&s=842f46e7ad08032bf4e02b440a2296951596d13b\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/73gtjr6mp0wb1.png?width=2290&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8e12992f6ae428b9a3e901b752e08d44e132c00\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/93w13s6mp0wb1.png?width=2280&format=png&auto=webp&s=acfc319e0f01d9b801f4e5638b2223cbac453f4e\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lipj2r6mp0wb1.png?width=2300&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d426b1002edfc631cf849c20aff648098e6bb9\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a6j3qq6mp0wb1.png?width=2288&format=png&auto=webp&s=efa2c97f74d1ab6979ee398b9a0db595566851d7\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2x7bqq6mp0wb1.png?width=2302&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ed3229fe9bcf654e69c23cda4694bb75a7588d2\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7xmdoh7mp0wb1.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=b05bcf8ab41cc54a28ae7dd1dd2dcb844dca6563\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bckjwg7mp0wb1.png?width=2290&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebf196e1cd05bbc1a4ae0d20282dedb0fc4061b4\n\n&#x200B;","title":"\ud83d\udca5 Tokenomics and Token Distribution \ud83d\udca5 (Including illustrations for some of the Top Cryptocurrencies)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698095917,"id":"17evfsy"}

{"selftext":"I am the founder of a Swiss startup involved in the tokenization of shares and bonds. Too often, I hear how useful and great the tokenization of shares and assets is. **The reality is that it is not!**\n\nIn Switzerland by now, several companies have their shares tokenized, and some companies and cantons have issued bonds on-chain. The Swiss Digital Exchange (the blockchain branch of the Swiss Stock Exchange) has been trying to make something out of their tokenization service since 2018, without making any progress.\n\nHuge institutions have spent millions trying to bring this new technology to global adoption and failed. The Australian stock exchange has closed operation since end of 2022 after writing off $170M.\n\n[https:\/\/decrypt.co\/114909\/australias-biggest-stock-exchange-shelves-blockchain-project-writes-off-170m](https:\/\/decrypt.co\/114909\/australias-biggest-stock-exchange-shelves-blockchain-project-writes-off-170m)\n\n**Why hasn't tokenization gained global traction yet?**\n\nIt's very simple, tokenization on its own is just a marginal improvement, it's not a 10x improvement from the previous system, justifying the effort of learning and switching onto this new system. On its own, it improves a bit the efficiencies of moving assets around, but the current system is quite good already.\n\n**Where and how does tokenization make sense?**\n\nLet's take an example to explain my point:\n\n**Startup crowdfunding**\n\nIf today you invest in startups unless you are a HNWI or have some good connections, you will have to go through crowdfunding platforms like Republic or Seedrs.\n\nChoose a startup, invest, and perhaps a year later, you decide to sell. You list your intention to sell on the platform, hoping for a buyer. The illiquidity of startup investments for a seller remains a hurdle; tokenizing these shares doesn't necessarily change this if only platform members can buy from you.\n\nAnd before someone brings up the potential of share fractionalization through tokenization \u2013 you might wanna know that shares can't be fractionalized by law below one share. The entire notion of fractionalization is a pervasive myth in the tokenization space.\n\n>Tokenization doesn't automatically result in liquidity; it unlocks the potential for liquidity.\n\n**The Real Potential of Tokenization**\n\nLies in improving the current status quo by making startup shares tradable and liquid as as listed stocks or crypto.\n\nHere is where tokenization comes in handy. The current platform and traditional exchanges are not suitable for low-traded assets, and therefore, market makers would not make enough money, and probably, there would not be big trading volumes at the beginning to justify the costs of creating a market.\n\nHere is why if you tokenize startup shares, and you use a DEX to make them tradable 24\/7, here is where the 10x materialize. Startups would tokenize just the portion of equity that they want to sell in order to raise funds from an army of retail investors and once they raise a portion of the funds raised is allocated to a liquidity pool on a DEX, effectively seeding the people with some USDC and some tokenize shares so you have the pair in the pool.\n\nHence, you achieve what before was unimaginable continuous liquidity of startup shares, this is a 10x improvement and tokenization here make sense cause otherwise you could not interact with a DEX.\n\nLet me know what your thoughts folks.","title":"Tokenization of Assets doesn\u2019t make sense unless it improves the liquidity of assets.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698140848,"id":"17f8zau"}

{"selftext":"Balancer's front end was attacked on the 20th of September. The hackers were able to steal approximately $240,000 in user funds.\n\nOn the same day, I was looking to put my stablecoins to work in DeFi and considered Balancer as a great candidate. Something was telling me to not do anything with my stablecoins, and just leave them where they are. Fortunately, I listened to my instincts. Otherwise, one year of hard work and sacrifice to accumulate stablecoins would've gone down the drain.\n\nApparently, Metamask actually uses some blockchain security tools to detect such activities and they were warning users trying to interact with Balancer's front end. That's when I started to look into such tools and research a bit more.\n\nWhether we like it or not, the internet is filled with scams, phishing attacks, hackers, etc. The same occurs in crypto, although to an even greater extent. As a user, we MUST protect ourselves and learn how to mitigate, or even better, completely avoid these attacks. BUT, the software you interact with (websites, smartphone\/desktop applications, decentralized applications, web3 wallets, etc.) MUST also protect its users.\n\nToday, I'm very careful with every click I perform when doing web3 stuff such as connecting a wallet to a website, transferring funds, or providing liquidity. With that being said, not everything can be avoided. Fortunately, some of today's dApps utilize blockchain security tools.\n\n**Let's go through a few:**\n\n* Forta *(used by Lido Finance)*\n* Wallet Guard *(used by Metamask)*\n* Hexagate *(used by QuickSwap)*\n* Chaos Labs *(used by Aave)*\n\nIn this hectic risky crypto world we're living in, we need to take every possible precaution to avoid losing our hard-earned assets. The names above are just a few, I myself, have trust in. Of course, this is a non-exhaustive list. There are many more that use blockchain security tools.\n\nI hope this has, at least, sparked a bit of curiosity so you can ensure the web3 software you're using is taking advantage of security tools.","title":"The story of how I ALMOST got my wallet drained.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698182379,"id":"17fnoa9"}
{"selftext":"I would have posted this in the daily but someone deleted it - lol!\n\nu\/aminok [recently requested](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/ogugf9\/comment\/k4swhgj\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a new tip bot that is command activated (e.g. !tip) activated to aide with mobile tipping.  Per his request, he asked for a bot \"... \\[that\\] posts a comment in response to a command that contains a link that when clicked opens the donut.finance tipping page with the URL populated with the content information\"\n\nI have spent some time working on a proof of concept for this bot and it meets the requirements to pass metadata about the comment\/post\/person being tipped.  However, I also ran across some difficulties that I didnt foresee originally, mainly focused around the Reddit markdown editor not generating links for a common protocol (dapp:\/\/) that mobile wallets generally react to, as well as some specific [iOS bugs](http:\/\/www.openradar.me\/radar?id=4999496467480576) that route requests to the App Store instead of the appropriate app.\n\nTo overcome this shortcoming, I opted for another approach using deep linking to activate the mobile wallet.  This approach works **ONLY** if the Reddit app is set up to use the System Default Web Browser (Settings > Open Links > Default Browser).  If this setting is not enabled, Reddit will launch an in-app browser that is not capable of connecting a wallet to.\n\nAn example of the bot output, so you can test it out (the verbiage is subject to change):\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u200b**DESKTOP:** [Leave a tip](https:\/\/www.donut.finance\/tip\/?action=tip&contentId=t1_k63pns4&recipient=mattg1981&address=0xd762e68a2d30ab4d836683c421121AbB5b3e1DcC)\n\n**MOBILE (Metamask Only):** [Leave a tip](https:\/\/metamask.app.link\/dapp\/https:\/\/www.donut.finance\/tip\/?action=tip&contentId=t1_k63pns4&recipient=mattg1981&address=0xd762e68a2d30ab4d836683c421121AbB5b3e1DcC)\n\n**MOBILE (Coinbase Wallet Only):** [Leave a tip](https:\/\/go.cb-w.com\/dapp?cb_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donut.finance%2Ftip%2F%3Faction%3Dtip%26contentId%3Dt1_k63pns4%26recipient%3Dmattg1981%26address%3D0xd762e68a2d30ab4d836683c421121AbB5b3e1DcC)\n\n*This output was generated by a bot.  The mobile links work best if you use the System Default Browser (Settings > Open Links > Default Browser)*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI\/We are looking for feedback on this approach.  You can see that we have two wallets supported (Metamask and Coinbase Wallet) as those are the two that I have installed currently on my phone.  I can theoretically add support for more wallets (assuming they support deep linking) - but we also risk the bot output getting messy.  While providing feedback about this approach, please consider the following questions:\n\n1) Are you willing to switch to System Default Web browser to make mobile tipping in r\/EthTrader easier?\n\n2)  I was only able to test on iOS, if you are an Android user - does this approach also work for you? (If no, please try enabling System Default Web browser handling the links)\n\n3) Since having a generic handler for all wallets is not possible, should we only support a single wallet (MetaMask)?\n\n4) Are you aware of a more generic way to handle this that will be wallet agnostic?\n\n5) General Suggestions?","title":"Feedback Requested - New Tip Handling Bot","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698182886,"id":"17fnvv6"}

This means that they have to KYC all their users to send them a 1099 form that includes every single transaction.\n\nThese rules, if applied broadly could even impact liquidity providers, validators and miners.\n\nAlso, Uniswap, AAVE and other permissionless protocols are not built for this and it would basically make it impossible to use these inside the US due to the sheer amount of paper work.\n\nThese rules are completely unnecessary, people already use crypto and do their taxes, since everything is open and permissionless, it's easy to track your transaction and report your taxes. There's no need to KYC everyone and to give out sensitive information to multiple entities.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren even sent a letter to the IRS urging them to implement these rules as soon as possible (in early 2024), since she's eager to completely kill this space.

{"selftext":"**Introduction:**\n\nDonuts, the unique tokens that represent community contributions and engagement on the r\/ethtrader subreddit on the Ethereum ecosystem. While they serve as a sort of \"spendable and tradeable Karma,\" they also introduce a level of transparency and decentralization that is a significant departure from traditional online community platforms.\n\nDonuts are tokens that follow the ERC-20 standard, representing RPC specific to the r\/ethtrader. This implementation of community tokens is essentially a way to reward and recognize community contributions. As a result, they are tradeable and spendable, providing an exciting new way to interact within the ethtrader. Donuts exist on both the Ethereum mainnet and Gnosis chain, allowing users to transact seamlessly.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bjcclxllocwb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d05682fdc700e0fd0cfba5b618fafae09305cd7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The History of Donuts:**\n\nDonuts have been a part of the ethtrader community since 2018, although they were initially just numbers stored on Reddit's servers. The transition to becoming decentralized occurred in late 2019 and early 2020. This move towards decentralization not only added a layer of trust but also allowed for greater transparency within the project.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gdohrjtdocwb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a05335e83f66487f8b65c3037c5130fd7eb81bc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Transparency through Mods:**\n\nOne remarkable aspect of the donut project's transparency is the list of trusted mods who hold Ethereum addresses. These mods are long-standing members of the r\/ethtrader community, ensuring that the project is in safe hands.

Anyone can track and contribute to the project by visiting their GitHub repository at [https:\/\/github.com\/EthTrader](https:\/\/github.com\/EthTrader). This level of openness allows for community participation, ensuring that the project remains accountable and transparent.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pkdvkptbpcwb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=38749960aad57872f5b097706bdbc6f2912d057d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Multisig Members:**\n\nThe project maintains further transparency through multisig members who control the EthTrader Treasury. This group can vote to pass measures with at least five out of nine members voting for it. The current members include:\n\n* u\/dont_forget_canada\n* u\/nootropicat\n* u\/MemeyCurmudgeon\n* u\/Basoosh\n* u\/carlslarson\n* u\/aminok\n* u\/rustedpopcorn\n* u\/kohrts\n* u\/Jake123194\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese members help in safeguarding the project's treasury and its funds, ensuring a transparent and accountable management structure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nDonuts on the r\/ethtrader subreddit represent a unique and innovative way to reward community contributions. The project's transparency, decentralization, and the involvement of trusted mods and multisig members are the pillars that support this innovative system. Open-source contributions and community engagement further enhance the transparency of the project, making donuts a pioneering example of how online communities can utilize blockchain technology for the benefit of their members.","title":"Mods, Transparency, and Trust: A Deep Dive into Donut, r\/ethtrader's Community Token","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698240979,"id":"17g4zft"}

{"selftext":"It seems that people think that the hype around blockchain technology is pretty low lately. Some even think that blockchain innovation has stagnated. But I'm not so sure about it...   \n \n\nHow do you feel about it?   \n \n\nI mean, there are plenty of things going on regarding blockchain technology. Projects such as Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth, and NeuroChain have gained interest in a variety of industries, including supply chain management, healthcare, and finance. And one of the most recent blockchain advancements is the emphasis on interoperability and cross-chain solutions. Polkadot and Cosmos are two projects that aim to build networks that promote communication and data sharing between numerous blockchains. This method enables developers to create applications that can connect with many blockchains, thus opening up new possibilities and use cases.   \n \n\nButerin's primary concern revolves around the potential stagnation of the crypto industry due to a lack of ongoing innovation. He emphasizes the need for continuous progress to prevent the abandonment of ambitious goals like enhancing privacy and open internet infrastructure. Blockchain's maturation is a key theme in Buterin's perspective. He stresses the importance of proactively achieving privacy and open internet infrastructure goals rather than becoming complacent in a competitive crypto landscape.   \n \n\nHis insights also reflect a growing preoccupation with blockchain technology's role in transforming the digital world. As the crypto space matures, addressing concerns related to innovation and blockchain's role in the broader technology landscape is imperative. Buterin's commitment to blockchain's ethical development aligns with the crypto community's principles, aiming for a more inclusive, secure, and technologically advanced future.   \n \n\nI just think that the blockchain industry is approaching a period in which real-world adoption and realistic use cases are taking center stage. So I wouldn't say that blockchain innovation has stagnated but rather progressed and matured over time.

{"selftext":"In today's fast-paced digital world, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology continue to shape the future of finance and everyday life. One such innovation that's gaining traction is the Donut Token. Donut Token, often abbreviated as DONUT, is not just another crypto coin; it's a revolutionary concept with the potential to transform the way we interact with financial services, rewards, and much more in our daily lives.\n\nWhat is Donut Token?\n\nDonut Token is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency designed to create a seamless bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain. This digital asset has taken inspiration from DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and aims to offer users a myriad of benefits beyond just being a means of exchange. The Donut Token is poised to offer users the perfect blend of simplicity, accessibility, and utility in the world of crypto.\n\nDonut Token isn't just about investment; it's about functionality and real-world use cases. Here's how it can make your daily life sweeter:\n\n1. Financial Inclusion: \n\nDonut Token is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for individuals of all backgrounds to participate in the crypto ecosystem. This inclusivity can provide access to financial services for those who have been underserved by traditional banking systems.\n\n2. Rewards and Loyalty Programs: \n\nDonut Token can be integrated into various rewards and loyalty programs. Imagine earning DONUTs for your everyday purchases and then redeeming them for discounts, freebies, or even converting them into other cryptocurrencies.\n\n3. Cross-Border Transactions: \n\nSending money internationally can be costly and time-consuming. Donut Token allows for low-fee, fast, and secure cross-border transactions, saving you time and money on international transfers.\n\n4. NFTs and Digital Collectibles: \n\nThe Donut Token ecosystem can be used for buying, selling, and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital collectibles. This could open up a new world of digital art, music, and other collectibles for enthusiasts and collectors.\n\n5. Micropayments: \n\nWith minimal transaction fees, Donut Token is perfect for microtransactions. You can tip content creators, pay for digital content, and support your favorite online communities without the fear of exorbitant fees.\n\nSecurity and Transparency\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Donut Token is the security and transparency provided by blockchain technology. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, making it virtually tamper-proof and ensuring trust among users. Additionally, smart contracts govern many aspects of Donut Token, reducing the need for intermediaries and lowering the risk of human error.\n\n\nThe Donut Token is more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a tool that can revolutionize the way we handle financial transactions, rewards, and digital assets in our daily lives. Its simplicity and versatility make it a promising option for both newcomers and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. As the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, Donut Token stands out as a sweet addition, providing the potential for a more accessible, inclusive, and efficient financial future for all.\n\nSo, whether you're a cryptocurrency enthusiast or someone new to the world of digital assets, keep an eye on Donut Token, as it might just be the innovation that sweetens your daily life.","title":"Donut Token: A Sweet Innovation That Can Revolutionize Your Daily Life","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698347475,"id":"17h41e1"}

{"selftext":"Hey fellow ethtraders!\n\nAs many of you are aware, there have been some significant changes in how Reddit operates and interacts with the RCP lately. The recent announcement from Reddit admins regarding the sunset of RCPs (Reddit Community Points), including Donut, has sparked a lot of discussion and concerns among the members and mods of r\/ethtrader. One of the most critical aspects affected by this change is the monthly CSV file that provided karma points, a key criteria for Donut distribution. The only tangible change we're facing is the discontinuation of the monthly CSV file that used to provide us with karma points. This means that while reddit's role is diminishing, the Donut system's fundamentals remain intact. It continues to be an essential part of our community, rewarding and encouraging active participation and quality contributions. This got me thinking, and I'm sure it has for many of you as well: How do we adapt and ensure the continued success of the Donut system in our community?\n\nCurrently, the Donut distribution is based on various factors, including:\n\n* Posts: 510K Donuts per distribution\n* Comments: 340K Donuts per distribution\n* Bonus to Posts, by Receiving Tips: 340K Donuts per distribution\n* Community Treasury Funds: 255K Donuts per distribution\n* Donut Tipping & Content Curation: 170K Donuts per distribution\n* Uniswap Liquidity Incentives: 400K Donuts per distribution\n* Honeyswap Liquidity Incentives: 200K Donuts per distribution\n* Moderation: 85K Donuts per distribution\n\nNow that Reddit is no longer providing the CSV file, it's time for us, the community and the mods, to think about the future of Donuts. Here are some questions and ideas to consider:\n\n1. **Relying on Reddit or Going Independent:** One option is to rely less on Reddit's karma points and shift our focus to an independent system. For instance, we could convert Posts and Comments Donuts into Bonus Donuts earned through receiving tips. This way, we maintain a form of community-driven reward system, ensuring that quality posts are still rewarded.\n2. **Exploring Reliable Metrics:** Are there alternative and reliable metrics we can use to calculate Donut distribution? Perhaps we can consider engagement metrics, post quality, or even community voting to determine who deserves Donuts.\n3. **Diversifying Criteria:** We may also think about diversifying the criteria for distribution, such as rewarding contributions to the community treasury, quality moderation efforts, and more. A broader spectrum of factors can make the distribution more inclusive and balanced.\n4. **Community Input:** It's important to involve the entire community in the decision-making process. We should consider holding a discussion and even a vote to determine what changes the majority of the community supports.\n5. **Long-Term Viability:** We should also think about the long-term viability of the Donut system. What can we do to ensure that it remains a vibrant and fair system that benefits both the most active members and the broader community?\n\nThis transition is undoubtedly a challenge, but it's also an opportunity for us to take ownership and shape the future of the Donut system in a way that best serves our community. What are your thoughts on this? How do you envision the future of Donuts in r\/ethtrader? Let's discuss and work together to ensure our community remains a vibrant and rewarding place for all members.","title":"[DISCUSSION] Ensuring Donut Distribution's Future in r\/ethtrader Post Reddit Changes","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1698379682,"id":"17hf54g"}

{"selftext":"Hey guys, \n\nI've been thinking a lot recently about the past bull run in 2021, when crypto was unavoidable on social media, and how the next bull may take shape. It led me to think about the implications of TikTok, and it's main audience: Gen Z. This is mostly just me sharing my thoughts and opening up a discussion.\n\n# TikTok\n\nTikTok is one of the most used used social media platforms worldwide. With over 1 billion monthly active users, TikTok has tremendous power to influence the world, especially on Gen Z. To put this into perspective, here are some stats:\n\n* Available in 154 countries\n* Over 1 billion monthly active users\n* Users spend **an average of 1.5 hours per day** on the platform\n* Users open the app **an average of 8 times per day.**\n* 60% of TikTok's users are Gen Zers\n\n([source here](https:\/\/wallaroomedia.com\/blog\/social-media\/tiktok-statistics\/#:~:text=60%25%20are%20between%20the%20ages,data%20comes%20straight%20from%20TikTok))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Gen Z and their investment strategies\n\nGen Z (born 1997-2012) grew up in the digital age, which has made this generation much more open to exploring digital innovation, and more importantly: crypto. As of 2021, Gen Z had **360 billion** in disposable income (according to this [Bloomberg report](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-11-17\/gen-z-has-360-billion-to-spend-trick-is-getting-them-to-buy)). Gen Z is also much more likely to take financial advice from social media ([source](https:\/\/moneyzine.com\/news\/2022\/10\/18\/gen-zs-reliance-on-social-media-leaving-them-most-vulnerable-to-online-fraud\/)). *Do you* s*ee where this is going?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The next bull market and FOMO\n\nDuring the next bull market, the influx of Gen Z investors could significantly impact the crypto market, as we've seen it in the past bullrun. If a coin becomes viral on TikTok, the echo chamber created by this space can easily create a surge in demand, making the coin's value explode overnight. I can easily see the hype on TikTok directly influencing the market.\n\nSeeing those coins explode, and investment stories becoming popular as well, I can also see FOMO easily creeping in. This is very bullish for ETH, but also do keep in mind that *this will be the time to sell.*\n\n\/\/\n\nFor the record, I am technically part of Gen Z, but I don't use TikTok. I was active in the crypto space during the last bull market of 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What do you think? \n\nWhat do you think the role of social media will be in the next bull market? And most importantly, what will be different next time? \n\nI'm genuinely curious to see your answers, and if you have anything to add to this topic!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","title":"TikTok, Gen Z and FOMO","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698394157,"id":"17himqy"}

{"selftext":"Nocturne is a novel protocol developed to enable \u2018private accounts\u2019 on Ethereum.  \n\n\nBlockchain explorer tools, such as Etherescan, have made detailed information about an individual\u2019s financial history and status available to anyone with an internet connection and inclination. With Nocturne, Ethereum users can interact with the blockchain ecosystem while maintain privacy over their personal and sensitive information. Via the use of zero-knowledge technology, \u201cNocturne allows users to deposit or receive funds to private, stealth addresses within the Nocturne contracts.\u201d  \n\n\nPut simply, Nocturne is a \u201cprivate account abstraction protocol\u201d.  \n\n\nIn order for a user to leverage Nocturne\u2019s privacy-preserving functionality, they must first deposit some crypto into Nocturne\u2019s \u2018Deposit Manager contract\u2019. For the time being, an off-chain party must then approve the funds, deeming the transaction to be below a certain compliance risk threshold. This is an initial methodology in order to avoid illicit transactions. However, over time, the process will become increasingly permissionless, with a novel process known as \u2018proof-of-innocence\u2019, at the core of the protocol\u2019s future plans.  \n\n\nOnce a deposit has been approved, privacy is preserved by running all transactions through a sole-teller contract, which bundles private operations before handing them onto the \u2018Handler contract\u2019, which carries out all further contract calls and, in doing so, preserves the privacy of the end user.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zt4m3mup1rwb1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7282171f7117f5721c79cc16b56bb30b7b02030\n\nI'm glad to see innovations regarding blockchain. The last aspect of blockchain technology that has me quite interested is Neurochain, which uses AI. I see more and more businesses beginning to adopt a blockchain and AI combination. And one of the most recent blockchain advancements is the emphasis on interoperability and cross-chain solutions. Polkadot and Cosmos are two projects that aim to build networks that promote communication and data sharing between numerous blockchains.  \n\n\nAnd when it comes to Nocturne, I believe Nocturne\u2019s future is far from certain. However, privacy-preserving technology is a topic of increasing interest within the crypto community, so it's not surprising why people are so hyped about it. What are your thoughts?

{"selftext":"Copy-pasting my comment from the last daily, for those who didn't get the chance to read it:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Last night I've been on and off in some calls with relevant members of communities that are interested in joining the (hopefully) future [expansion program](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17dxbz4\/governance_discussion_expand_donut_earning_to\/). I'm really excited for this and I actually think we're getting somewhere  \n>  \n>I'll keep on posting the small updates here, until I have a strong enough structure to write up a final megathread with Q&A's and eventually post a governance proposal  \n>  \n>So here's what I got from yesterday:  \n>  \n>\u2022 All applications must be published in advance on this sub, in order to guarantee transparency  \n>  \n>\u2022 Any member of the community can apply, this includes mods  \n>  \n>**This is the most both complex and interesting topic: Earnings. There are multiple ways we can do this:**  \n>  \n>\u2022 The communities that would be a part of the program would receive a percentage of our own distribution. This means ethtrader's share would decrease and consequently our users would earn less Donuts. This was suggested by u\/aminok himself and I understand it might get some controversy. So I decided to suggest some adjustments to this. The subs would only earn according to points in posts only. Comments and other bonuses would not be included. This makes everyone a winner, without hurting our part of the distribution too much. The tipping system may also be included. In conclusion, they would earn according to points in publications and have a fund for tips.  \n>  \n>\u2022 The communities that would be a part of the program would only receive a small fund, according to their size and traffic, to use in a tipping system between them. No earnings on posts or comments. Now in this suggestion there are two possibilities, either we provide a portion of our distribution to a treasury for these subs, to be used for tips. Or they fund their own treasury, buying a portion of Donuts. In this option they would not have so much to gain from us directly. But in return, there could be free advertising from us, and at least they would have an extra incentive for new members to join their community.  \n>  \n>\u2022 Every community that gets accepted would have free advertisement.  \n>  \n>In short, we have two options here when it comes to financing this project. Either the accepted communities buy Donuts, create a treasury and fund themselves, with our full support for whatever is needed, or we finance their earnings, through our distribution. If it's the latter, I think we can remove our tipping bonus and use it to finance the expansion program. I think this bonus is not that important in our distribution, and unfortunately it is only used to abuse the system, benefiting those who spam tips and repeat the process between groups.  \n>  \n>It is important to point out that, for me, the least penalizing and most optimal option for us would be to limit the earnings of other communities to posts only, with the option of a tipping system. This ensures that our members don't spread across other subs and prevents manipulation attempts.\n\nAuthor: u\/Friendly-Airline2426\n\n[Link](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17i1pnt\/daily_general_discussion_october_28_2023_utc0\/k6r9bou\/)","title":"[DD Nominated Comment] Copy-pasting my comment from the last daily, for those who didn't get the chance to read it: &#x200B; >Last night I've been on and off in some calls","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1698488941,"id":"17iax8c"}

{"selftext":"smash or pass?\n\n\n\n___\n\nOk I can't post this because the word count is too short, so to pump it up, here's an excerpt of a convo i had with a friend discussing why crypto has intrinsic value: \n\n\n\nFinancial empires undergo short and long term debt cycles. During these cycles, the economy expands or contracts based on the supply demand of goods and the availability of credit or presence of debt. \n\nAt the beginning of an empire's long term debt cycle, money starts off as a hard asset (gold has proven to be the #1 asset in this regard). This is because a strong flourishing economy needs to be based on a monetary system that cannot easily be inflated through quantitative easing. \n\nGold fulfills this role because it possesses a lot of properties conducive to it being a monetary premium. It's portable, easily divisible, durable, pretty salable etc. but most importantly, it's scarce. \n\nGold's scarcity comes from the fact that it's flow rate (the rate at which new gold is mined) is extremely consistent and low, at around 1-2% a year. As such, it trumps other historical forms of money such as beads, seashells, salt, because there comes a point where the supply of these currencies can be inflated dramatically (and of course people are highly incentivised to do this) leading to currency debasement. \n\nThis is why gold has remained in use across different societies for millennia, as opposed to other forms of money which have died out relatively fast. \n\nNow we can argue on some level that gold is intrinsically valuable. The scarcity is what drives the value. If we do not stop here we suffer infinite regress. \n\nNow compare cryptocurrencies to gold. \n\nCrypto satisfies all the criteria for money just like gold does, like fungibility, divisibility, portability, salability. \n\nAnd like gold, it is highly scarce. The supply has been programmatically predetermined to be only 21 million bitcoin, with the final fraction of bitcoin to be mined in 2140.\n\nTheoretically, this means if demand increases, and supply is extremely slow to increase and will eventually cease entirely, then it makes owning even 1 bitcoin highly valuable in a world where stock is scarce. Of course, it's only valuable if demand is still present. And that's a big if. \n\nAnd so theoretically, bitcoin is a great store of value as long as demand holds. Now let's talk about the other function of money - as a medium of exchange. \n\nYou mentioned volatility. BTC for sure sucks ass as a medium of exchange right now. Why would you buy something with BTC now when the value could skyrocket or fall? \n\nBut volatility is a feature of assets with low market capitalisations. As if now, the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market is only ~$1 trillion. Compare that with gold which has a market cap of ~$13 trillion, or the US equity markets which has ~$42 trillion. As we see the market cap increase, we should see a proportionate increase in price stability. \n\nYou mention that people are predicting something like $64k\/btc by 2024. They're saying this because of something called Bitcoin Halvings (or halvenings). \n\nEvery 4 years, the issuance rate of newly mined BTC is halved, causing a supply shock at around 8 months after the halving. As more demand for btc increases, and supply flow decreases, making it more scarce. The price begins to rise, causing more investors to enter the space, which makes the price even more, thus creating a positive feedback loop. \n\nThis is why historically bitcoin bubbles have run on a 4 year cycle. We saw the price skyrocket in 2013, 2017, 2021. And so to follow the trajectory, 2025 should be the next time we see parabolic price action. \n\nOf course we don't know how much of this is just narrative driving the cycles. People seem so certain now of these trends that it seems to be priced in. Would it shock me if 2025 came and nothing happened? I'd find it interesting for sure but wouldn't faze me. \n\nWhat would faze me is if the technology behind bitcoin is corrupted to the extent that the decentralised ledger ceases to function. This would be the only thing to make me lose faith in cryptocurrency. To me, the value behind BTC is not its price. It's value is it's ability to produce incorruptible records of value. \n\nWill crypto make it through the crash? \n\nThere are rumours that the US financial system is coming to the end of a long-term debt cycle. All the signs age present. The US is in trillions of dollars of debt that cannot be paid off anytime soon. The money supply has been astronomically inflated, leading to a dramatic devaluing of the dollar and a cost-of-living crisis. Credit expansion is also being driven by banks which pre-pandemic operated on fractional-reserve banking, but now do no-reserve banking! \n\nThis all originated from Nixon nixing the Gold Standard in '71. Severing the tie to hard assets allows for fiat currency to create claims on money instead of actually holding money to transact. In a fiat system, all money is debt. \n\nIn the eventuality of the dollar collapsing (which could potentially be avoided in what Dalio calls a \"beautiful deleveraging\" in which debt burdens are reduced), liquidity would flow into other currencies and assets. Could it be crypto? Who knows. \n\nBased on all the above I consider it sensible to have some of my portfolio in crypto. It's a possible hedge.","title":"I have an important question about Vitalik Buterin","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1698495601,"id":"17iclli"}

{"selftext":"Recently, I've been contemplating the untapped potential of Reddit's tokenized community points project. What I dwell on the most is that Reddit developers had already set the stage for a site-wide implementation. They had a functional Vault and [comprehensive documentation ready to go](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20230320194142\/https:\/\/reddit.com\/community-points\/documentation\/developers). The only piece missing was the executive decision to go live.\n\nConsider this: Reddit has around 140,000 active communities. If even a quarter of these communities were to introduce their community points, that's a staggering 35,000 independent tokens. To provide some context, Reddit's two official Community Points during their trial phase had market caps of $10 million and $28 million, respectively. The magnitude of the opportunity for crypto mass adoption is enormous.\n\nNow, let's delve into the opportunities this could unlock for a company like Coinbase:\n\n1. **Web3 Integration:** By pivoting Reddit to a Web3 site, Coinbase would be in possession of the largest crypto site in the world. This transition would not only allow users to have more control over their data but would also enable new ways to monetize and drive engagement on the sit\u00f7.\n\n2. **Decentralized Finance** With the launch of tens of thousands tokens, each with a real community of stakeholders behind it, Coinbase could add millions of users to DeFi. Think of trading, lending and borrowing based on community engagement.\n\n3. **New Revenue Streams:** Beyond advertising, Reddit can explore token-based monetization. This might include token staking for premium features or selling avatars for community points.\n\n4. **Compensating Users:** Tokens can be used to directly reward content creators and curators. That might lead to Reddit seeing its monthly traffic massively increase, which would make it a more valuable web property for Coinbase.\n\nThe bigger picture here is that with the community points project launched, crypto as a whole would see a massive boost on adoption, and any company, like Coinbase, with a significant stake in the crypto economy, would stand to benefit from that.","title":"The case for a crypto company like Coinbase acquiring Reddit and the future of Community Points","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698501759,"id":"17iefx7"}

{"selftext":"Hey r\/ethtrader ,\n\nI've noticed that tipping donuts on this subreddit can be a bit challenging for many users, especially when trying to do so via mobile devices. After giving it some thought, I've come up with an idea to simplify the tipping process and make it more accessible.\n\nHere's the concept: What if we introduce a new way to tip using comments? Instead of struggling with MetaMask on mobile or desktop, users can tip a post by leaving a comment with a specific command. For example, a user can comment \"!tip 100\" to tip 100 donuts. During the distribution period, all \"tips\" commands in comments would be gathered, and the tips can be deducted from the actual donuts received during distribution, similar to how the paytopost system works.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this idea is feasible, or if it's something the community would be interested in. But I believe it's worth discussing and getting your feedback on this proposal. It's essential to maintain the original way of tipping through MetaMask for those who prefer that method, but having an alternative option could make tipping more inclusive and convenient for everyone.\n\nI'd love to hear what you all think about this idea. Should we explore the possibility of implementing it, or do you have other suggestions for improving the tipping experience on r\/ethtrader? Let's discuss, and perhaps the mods could weigh in on this as well.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and opinions below, and let's work together to make donut tipping more accessible for all members of our fantastic community! \n\n ","title":"[DISCUSSION] Implementing Donut Tipping via Comments - a Topic Worth Discussing?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698571162,"id":"17iz5sz"}

{"selftext":"What does \"Have a Plan\" Look Like?  \n\n\nWe hear it often enough in the sub or any crypto sub, really.\n\n \"Have a plan\" or \"DCA\" or even \"DYOR\" but what does that look like. For me, this is what, 'have a plan' looks like. Feel free to add any extra wisdom or lessons learned as well.\r  \n\r  \n1- First step was the DYOR phase or determine what project to invest in. For fairly safe and sure price growth, Eth and BTC are two good bets. They're essentially the 'blue chips' of the crypto space and if you get confused or overwhelmed by all of the projects and the terminology, they're a good starting point. White papers are a great read though they can be technically daunting. Development plans or cycles help as well, like the bitcoin halving cycle \/ calendar or Eth development plan.\r  \n\r  \n2- Second step is determine how much you can afford to invest that wouldn't break you if you lost it. This is the 'don't invest more than you can afford to lose' phase. Be honest and serious about your budget. For me, it's 250$ every two weeks out of each paycheck, with an additional bump whenever I get unexpected stuff, like a tax return or a small bonus this year, making sure not to stretch out or expand debt to be able to invest.\r  \n\r  \n3- Third step is determine your exit price. This will be the price at which you start to DCA out or phase out your profits. By DCA out, you ensure you're not just taking whatever the price is at the time of exit but averaging it near your exit price. For example, for me, I have a few Eth that will be DCA out \\~10k. I'll take my profit on them in that range.\r  \n\r  \nHaving that price target in mind really helps with FOMO because knowing that i'm not selling til 10k means that right now, in the crab bear market, the day to day actions of the price chart, don't mean much because I'm DCAing in until I hit that exit price.\r  \n\r  \n4- Fourth step is expand that plan. By that I mean, like above, I've got a few ETH set aside to be sold at 10k. The rest will keep staking for longer term with an exit price of \\~25k. That might be 2030 or 2035, but knowing that exit point again helps me ignore the daily charts.\r  \n\r  \n5- Step 5 is plan where those profits are gonna go. I know I'll set \\~1\/3 to taxes (overplanning in case), a good chunk to pay off debt, and we're planning a small add-on to the house that those profits will take care of. Having that plan made out helps you hold firm until that exit price as well. If I know I need to be around 10k to sell, it reinforces that I don't care if the price point is 1650 or 1666, because I'm not selling anytime soon.\r  \n\r  \n6- Step 6 is plan for a small powder bag. One way I do this is keeping some USDC on one of the CEXs, nominally staked or yielding and earning a bit. Usually at a higher rate than a savings account. This is the gambling bag or moonshot bag or secondary portfolio, however you want to call it. This is the money you set aside for when things catch your interest. Whether it's legitimate like Moons or a pump and dump like Pepe that you want to throw some money in on a gamble. Plan for where those $$ come from and limit yourself to what you set aside for it and know your exit price as well.\r  \n\r  \n7 - Step 7 is determine if there's anything you can do to grow passively. I mentioned that I have some Eth and I have it staked or earning passively to grow my bags. There are options to grow your bags that don't take $$ but might take some time. If there's a hobby you enjoy that might earn some crypto or something passive like using BAT browser or something along those lines that help you get a fix during a prolonged and incredibly BORING crab-bear market.\r  \n\r  \nThat's what I got so far. What would you add? What have you learned in this market cycle or in this prolonged bear?\n\nAuthor: u\/raresanevoice\n\n[Link](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17ir46m\/daily_general_discussion_october_29_2023_utc0\/k6y6m9t\/)","title":"[DD Nominated Comment] What does \"Have a Plan\" Look Like?

The answer is NO. The token sales are usually simply methods of \"raising funds\" and essentially sell tokens with no real utility to retail customers that may not know the truth behind the sales. Some of those tokens do come with some utility like governance over protocol changes but most of the time it's an amount that won't have any real weight compared to insiders or creators. \n\nOne example is Loopring, their closed protocol\/ecosystem does not need LRC to function and users do not ever need to hold Loopring to use the wallet, transact or trade. Everything can be done by using ETH to pay for all transactions on their Zkrollup. Loopring holders are known for holding a token that has plummeted from the hype surrounding the LRC token (Down 95% from All time high). \n\nThere are a few other protocols like Scroll, ZKsync and Starknet that work perfectly and do not need their own token to work. They work perfectly fine using ETHER. So if anyone wants to reduce risk and invest in the token that will forever hold real value it's ETH for the entire Ethereum ecosystem.","title":"No need to Fomo into new protocol tokens","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698613026,"id":"17jcfej"}

{"selftext":"Hi BroNuts, the last time I posted an a\\*\\*d\\*\\*\\* post I was suspended from Reddit and had to unlock my account, probably some auto Bot tools.\n\nSo I will avoid trying to say the **'A' word with 7 letters** in it to mitigate such risks. But will point out the protocols with high chance of the 'a' word, and throw in their funding!\n\n**Huge Funding (<100m):**\n\n**1. ZKSync**\n\nThis is obviously the most popular one, with a rumoured **$458million** in funding. Juicy! The team has mentioned that 2024 will be the earliest they will do the 'A' word.\n\n**2. LayerZero (ZRO)**\n\nCoindesk has stated LayerZero has a **$3B valuation** after a single **Series B round that raised $120m** funding. Imo this is the token that will be the quickest to drop, rumours are it is imminent.\n\n**3. StarkNet**\n\nOn its series D funding, it raised **$100m on a $8B valuation**. Another huge one!\n\n**Huge Crypto entities (brand name will speak for itself)**:\n\n**4. PolygonZKEVM**\n\nThis one needs no introduction, but the 'a' word for $POL has not been confirmed. MATIC holders will migrate 1:1 to $POL, maybe the Polygon Foundation will further do an additional 'A' word - their CEO hinted there will be one, or could it just be bait to increase engagement for their ZKEVM chain?\n\n**5. LINEA**\n\nLINEA is the blockchain launched by **Coinsensys**, one of the biggest crypto companies out there and the company that founded Metamask. In place of the long-anticipated $MASK token, we could see a LINEA one instead.\n\n**6. BASE**\n\nThe **Blockchain of Coinbase.** I'm not sure if they will do the 'a' word, but apparently to some BroNuts they said they would be having one next year.\n\n**Mid-size funding (>100m, but less farmers could still mean sizable drop):**\n\n**7. Scroll**\n\nOne of the hottest L2s now, Scroll raised **$50m** on March.\n\n**8. Manta Pacific**\n\nManta just started their campaign, has raised **$60m** in funding so far. See my automod nominated comment for tips (i will put in comments)\n\n**9. Orbiter**\n\nThey have long teased an 'A' word. Unclear what their actual funding is.\n\n**General tips to qualify:**\n\nThey all actually follow similar general tips once you get used to it: Interact with the blockchain by making swaps across different weeks, bridging, or complete tasks to mint NFTs if there is a campaign. Helpful to follow the official Twitter pages of those projects you're interested in to see if there's any campaigns you can get involved in.\n\n**My Guides:**\n\nI will comment a single easy-to-read **3 step guide for one project a day, beginner style on the daily**. I know plenty out there have not done this before so it could be intimidating Hopefully it gets 3 nominations so it can get turned to a post\n\nI made one for Manta, which got converted to a post yesterday.\n\nSo all the best, my BAGMI farmers !!","title":"Farmers Unite!

{"selftext":"Hey community,\n\nI've been thinking about the mechanics behind our donut distribution and wanted to bring up an idea for discussion. I'd like to explore the possibility of using upvotes as a metric for the donut distribution snapshot, instead of karma.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Transparency:** Upvotes are transparent, and everyone can see them. Unlike karma, which is essentially a black box where only Reddit knows how it's calculated, upvotes are visible to all users, making the system more open and understandable.\n2. **Ease and Appropriate Data:** Upvotes are a more straightforward and appropriate metric for determining the distribution of donuts. They offer a more direct reflection of the community's approval of a user's content or contributions, making the process easier to manage and understand.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Doesn't Justify Quality Content:** Upvotes, while reflecting popularity, don't necessarily justify the quality of content. A highly upvoted meme or a quick one-liner might receive more donuts than a well-researched, thoughtful post. This could incentivize users to prioritize quantity over quality.\n2. **Easy to Buy\/Manipulate Upvotes:** The upvote system can be manipulated easily. Users can potentially buy upvotes or engage in vote manipulation to artificially boost their visibility and donut rewards, undermining the integrity of the system.\n3. **Vote Manipulation and Fake Upvotes:** Just like karma, the upvote system is susceptible to vote manipulation, including vote brigades and the use of fake upvotes from alternate accounts. This poses a risk to the fairness and accuracy of the donut distribution process.\n\nAny change to the donut distribution system should be thoroughly considered and discussed within the community. This post serves as an open forum to discuss the idea of using upvotes as a metric for donut distribution and to gather your thoughts, opinions, and suggestions on this topic.\n\nWhat are your views on this potential shift?

Zodia Custody expanded its services to markets in Asia-Pacific which includes Japan Australia and Singapore.  \n\n**News:** In April 2023 Standard Chartered invested in Zodia, providing Zodia Custody with financial and other support for development. This shows the confidence SCB has being a major global bank in the future of Zodia Custody and the crypto storage industry. \n\nAs part of broader expansion into the Asia-Pacific region, finally Zodia Custody has launched its services in Hong Kong.

{"selftext":"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Onyx recently experienced a significant security breach that resulted in the misappropriation of about $2.1 million.\nAccording to The Block, citing blockchain security firm BlockSec, the breach was due to a specific flaw within Onyx's system, termed as \"precision loss.\"\n\n\"The attacker took out a flash loan of a substantial amount of ETH, swapped it for PEPE, and donated it to a specific pool to manipulate the exchange rate.\n\nSubsequently, due to the so-called precision loss, the attacker was able to withdraw more of the underlying asset by burning fewer shares,\" Matthew Jiang, BlockSec's Director of Security Services, said\n\nJoin the conversation at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov 14. The event promises to address key concerns, trends, and solutions in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.\n\nInvestigations reveal that the vulnerability stemmed from an older forked rendition of Compound V2, a component deeply integrated into Onyx's foundational structure.\n\nThe latest on-chain data indicates that the attacker transferred a sum of 700 Ether\n (valued at approximately $1.25 million) to Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixing service.","title":"Onyx Suffers Breach As Attacker Swaps ETH For PEPE, 'Precision Loss' Of Over $2M","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698856639,"id":"17lg85y"}

In a robust market, the annualized premium, also known as the basis rate, generally falls within the range of 5% to 10%.\n\n\nThis data signifies a growing demand for leveraged long positions in ETH futures, as the futures contract premium skyrocketed from 1% on October 23 to 7.4% on October 30, surpassing the neutral-to-bullish threshold of 5%. This remarkable surge in the metric follows a 15.7% price rally for ETH over a two-week period.\n\nFurthermore, analysis of the options market provides additional insights. The 25% delta skew in Ether options serves as an indicator of when arbitrage desks and market makers might overcharge for upside or downside protection. An Ether price drop typically causes the skew metric to rise above 7%, while periods of optimism tend to exhibit a negative 7% skew.\n\nOf particular note, the Ether options 25% delta skew reached a negative 16% level on October 27, marking the lowest point in over 12 months. During this period, protective put (sell) options were trading at a discount, reflecting excessive optimism among traders. Additionally, the current 8% discount for put options represents a notable shift from the previously persistent 7% or higher positive skew that extended until October 18.","title":"Ethereum Network Growth Shoots With New Addresses, ETH Price to $2000?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1698906595,"id":"17lxcad"}

Here is the condensed version for those who are too lazy to read the full article:\n\n>**Nov. 6** \u2013 In response to the article, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of rival crypto exchange Binance, often referred to as \"CZ,\" said he would sell all of the company's holdings in FTT, which amount to $580 million worth of the token.  \n>  \n>**Nov. 8** \u2013 FTX reached a deal to sell itself to Binance, the crypto exchange whose executive had helped trigger the selloff.  \n>  \n>**Nov. 9 \u2013** Binance withdrew from the deal to acquire FTX.  \n>  \n>**Nov. 10** \u2013 A Bahamian financial regulator froze the assets of FTX.  \n>  \n>**Nov. 11** \u2013 FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections as it assesses the value of its remaining assets, a company announcement said.  \n>  \n>**Nov. 12** \u2013 [The Wall Street Journal](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/alameda-ftx-executives-are-said-to-have-known-ftx-was-using-customer-funds-11668264238) reported that FTX lent customer deposits to Alameda Research to help it meet its liabilities, and top executives at Alameda Research were aware of it, raising further scrutiny about the relationship between Alameda Research and FTX.  \n>  \n>**Nov. 14** \u2013 The collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX became the subject of an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.  \n>  \n>**Nov. 16** \u2013 House lawmakers called on Bankman-Fried as well as executives at Alameda and Binance to testify in a hearing on Capitol Hill in December.  \n>  \n>**Nov. 17** \u2013 John Ray, the incoming CEO who was installed to guide the company through bankruptcy proceedings, said in a [court filing](https:\/\/pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/33\/188450\/042020648197.pdf) that he has never seen such a \"complete failure\" of corporate controls in his career, including during the Enron scandal.  \n>  \n>**Dec. 12** \u2013 Bankman-Fried was [arrested in the Bahamas](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/sam-bankman-fried-arrested-bahamas-prosecutor\/story?id=95105184) after federal prosecutors in New York filed criminal charges contained in a sealed indictment, according to the Royal Bahamas Police Force.  \n>  \n>**Dec. 13** \u2013 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors.","title":"Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the beginning of FTX's collapse","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698908548,"id":"17lxrwt"}

{"selftext":"Within the dynamic realm of DeFi, the pursuit of enhancing user interactions, ensuring smooth onboarding, fortifying security, and safeguarding privacy has remained an ongoing priority. After delving into extensive research, it becomes evident that account abstraction stands as a pivotal domain in this progressive landscape, offering a gateway to an array of secure and streamlined financial interactions.\u00a0.\n\u00a0\nThere has been a drastic shift and development in this area, scaling from the traditional wallet system we know to a more user-centric solution that has a lot of benefits for web3 users and also for web2 users that want to venture into web3.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat Exactly is Account Abstraction?\n\u00a0\nAccount Abstraction is a methodology that can be applied to blockchain accounts to usher in greater adaptability, diversity, and security for users. This is achieved by harnessing the power of smart contract accounts, which offer advantages to externally owned accounts (EOAs).\n\u00a0\n.\nThis was initially introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and has gained widespread recognition and substantial community support, particularly through ERC-4337. It is currently regarded as a cutting-edge trend within the blockchain. Here are a few wallets currently implementing account abstraction:\n\n1. Argent\nArgent is a user-friendly smart contract wallet emphasizing Layer 2 activities, tailored for cryptocurrency newcomers. It boasts social recovery, multi-signature capabilities, fee payments in stablecoins, and rapid batch transactions. Currently active on Ethereum Mainnet and Layer 2 solutions like zkSync and StarkNet.\n\u00a0\n2. ambire\nAmbire Wallet prioritizes user friendliness and security, serving both new and experienced users. It stands out with advanced features like batch transactions, multi-signature capabilities, and stablecoin fee payments across various blockchains. Their gas tank feature enables cost-effective transactions in preferred tokens.\n\u00a0\n3.

It is not official, and this post does not constitute a final governance proposal. The purpose of this megathread is to gather the community's input, finalize the draft, and answer any questions before submitting an official governance proposal. Your feedback and participation are essential in shaping the future of Donuts in the* r\/ethtrader *community.*\n\n# What is the Donut Expansion Program?\n\nThe Donut Expansion Program is a visionary initiative proposted by u\/Friendly-Airline2426, to broaden the economy of Donut rewards to eligible communities. Donuts are ERC-20 tokens awarded to the contributors of the r\/ethtrader subreddit, and this program seeks to extend these rewards to other communities.\n\n# Key Discussion Points\n\n* Which communities should be eligible to participate in the program and do they need to be crypto related?\n* What criteria should they meet to be considered?\n* What potential risks are associated with expanding Donut rewards, and how can these risks be mitigated?\n\n# Distributions\n\nHow will the Donut rewards be distributed to these communities? What should the distribution model look like?\n\nTo answer this question, there are two options presented by u\/Friendly-Airline2426 and u\/Aminok. Let's review them, along with the pros and cons for each scenario.\n\n# Scenario 1: Communities fund their own treasury with Donuts - Friendly-Airline2426\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* The most obvious advantage is the non-reduction of the percentage in the distribution of ethtrader and its contributors\n* We can make decisions independently without having to notify\/work with other subs (You'll understand what I mean in the Cons of Scenario 2)\n* It could be another use case for Donuts: Funding rewards for other communities. This will definitely have a positive impact on price and in the economy\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Joining the program may not be as beneficial for the communities, as they will have to finance their own treasury\n* The effectiveness of different communities in funding themselves and managing their treasuries may vary, leading to unpredictable outcomes and disparities in rewards within the program\/network\n\n# Scenario 2: Split distribution across communities - Aminok\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* \u2060A single distribution model ensures a consistent approach to Donut allocation, simplifying the system\n* \u2060It helps maintain equal opportunity for all communities, reducing potential disparities in rewards\n* \u2060A larger share of donuts for r\/ethtrader can motivate more participation within the main community. It can bring new users who were unaware of Donuts, while (potentially) making older users more active\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Adding other subs to our distribution would indirectly tie them to governance matter. Whatever happens on r\/ethtrader, would then need to happen in the other communities as Donut is the governance token here. This would involve a lot of bureaucracy and would require FULL coordination between all communities - **Aminok suggested giving a specific CONTRIB to each community, even though Donut is universal. So it would be as follows: CONTRIB-**r\/CommunityName**. By using this method, each sub has its own governance without interfering with each other**\n* ~~\u2060Managing different communities in terms of distro can be complex and may require additional administrative effort and oversight~~ \\- **This point has been clarified and will not be as much work as expected**\n* (Most) r\/ethtrader members may resist the idea of a shared distribution model, considering they'll earn less. Up to 50% less\n* \u2060Allocating Donuts to fund other communities may divert resources and attention away from r\/ethtrader's own initiatives and priorities\n\n*Regarding scenario 2, a 50-50 split in the current distribution was suggested. 50% to* r\/ethtrader *and the other 50% will be divided among the communities that join the program, INCLUDING* r\/ethtrader.  \n\n\nYour participation matters! Your input is important to shape the future of the Donut Expansion Program. We encourage you to:\n\n* Share your thoughts, suggestions, and concerns about the program\n* Ask any questions you may have regarding its implementation\n* Engage in constructive discussions with fellow community members\n\nTogether, we can refine this project and make it one that truly represents the interests and values of this community. After this megathread, the finalized proposal will be submitted, if approved it will then become a governance proposal. Thank you for your active participation, let's work together to expand the reach of Donuts in the entire ecosystem!\n\n# Links of interest\n\n* [First thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17dxbz4\/governance_discussion_expand_donut_earning_to\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [Summary](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17fry0p\/comment\/k6dtaq4\/?share_id=iELSrTVRdKaKw7VfYiqOt&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)\n* [Pros and Cons](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17lqslf\/comment\/k7huhqu\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)","title":"Donut Expansion Program Megathread - Q&A","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1698943765,"id":"17m7wqa"}

{"selftext":"It's quite simple why there will never be a real \"ETH killer\". It's all about the ecosystem. ETH is just too big at this point. I cannot imagine any sane company saying: \"Hey, let's abandon this project and all our customers and let's force them to move to this new shiny thing called XYZ\" it's not going to happen. \n\nThe same way people are too lazy to move from Apple to Android is because they are tied to the ecosystem already. They have their playlists, favourite apps, TV shows they watch on Apple TV or Google TV. \n\nThat's why people like Richard Hearts and Pulse chain for example will never succeed. He expected people to just drop their projects and transfer them to Pulse. Can you imagine someone like Uniswap saying: \"Ah screw it, we are closing this DEX, and we are now moving to Pulse\" it is not going to happen in a thousand years, because they would lose a lot of customers because of that.\n\nMost people are lazy, they will stick to current solutions. Heck, most people don't even want to Bridge to Layer 2 because they are too afraid of losing their funds or sometimes they just find it too hard. They are happy to just HODL on Layer 1, even when the fees are too high just like during the previous bull run, because they know that in a long run ETH will succeed.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\nTL;DR: Existing projects are tied to the current ETH ecosystem. Abandoning your user base and expecting them to move to this new shiny project just because fees are cheaper or maybe because it's faster is just wishful thinking.","title":"Why \"ETH killers\" will never succeed.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699007048,"id":"17mrxnc"}

After following all the steps (and a lots of troubleshooting), I ended up with a script that lets me input the thread ID from the URL and prints the data for the percentage of comments that include the word 'bronut'. I ran the script to get the data for one week, **creating the following results:**\n\n^(Details on how this script works will be found at the end of this post.)\n\n|October 27|9.8%|\n|:-|:-|\n|October 28|10.0%|\n|October 29|11.6%|\n|October 30|15.4%|\n|October 31|10.0%|\n|November 1|5.0%|\n|November 2|10.0%|\n\n# This data gives us an average of 10.3% of comments in the daily containing the word 'bronut' in the past week.\n\nI used this data to create this donut chart:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rsd69lsi97yb1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfc8ea51bcafad36805cf0ae477d003eed98a26f\n\nThis was pretty hard to make, because I initially made the script to include all spelling possibilities of 'bronut', but this seemed to overshoot the data, giving as high as 23.6% for some days, which didn't make sense when I went to confirm the data by looking at the daily. The script I finally ended up with had stats that were somewhat similar to the ones I collected manually prior, and therefore should be accurate.\n\nAs a closing note, I think this tool could also be used effectively to track the sentiment of this sub and other interesting metrics. Let me know what you think!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Now for the details of how the script works*\n\n# Here is how ChatGPT describes the breakdown of the mathematical terms and calculations involved for the script it created:\n\n>!The calculations in the script work by counting the number of comments that contain each of the specified words or their variations and then calculating the proportion of comments for each word.

{"selftext":"Long time OGs will remember my DONUT governance reports in the past.\n\nRecent discussion and changes to DONUT distributions have elicited from me a desire to being some basic data analysis regarding the composition of the community from the perspective of what I call the User Q factor.\n\nQ factor is defined as follows:\n\nQ = min(DONUT,CONTRIB)\/CONTRIB\n\nThe above number is basically a users current voting power divided by their maximum voting power.  \n\nTo make charts I take the Q factor and bin these into a number from 1-11.   Where 1 is a user that has between 0-10% Q factor (i.e. they have sold more than 90% of the DONUTs than they earned) and a 11 is a user that has sold less than 10% of all the DONUTs they have earned.\n\nI present a chart of the Q factors as determined by an analysis of the following user.csv shared with me by DaFunk in the \/r\/ethtrader discord [https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/609784425856761859\/1168190805505224725\/users.csv?ex=6550dd77&is=653e6877&hm=7aa8f379d03e7d5cda0e678088fc0011c8703979012eef40846db6814ea65e5f&](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/609784425856761859\/1168190805505224725\/users.csv?ex=6550dd77&is=653e6877&hm=7aa8f379d03e7d5cda0e678088fc0011c8703979012eef40846db6814ea65e5f&)\n\nIn this file each user name and associated wallet pubkey is shown with their CONTRIB and DONUT and is used for governance snapshot calculation.   You can see a variation of this on the dashboard [https:\/\/donut-dashboard.com\/#\/governance](https:\/\/donut-dashboard.com\/#\/governance)\n\nAll I have done is take this data and calculate the above DONUT Q factor for all users.\n\nHere is the bin histogram for ALL users from the above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DONUT Q factor - ALL registered \\\/r\\\/ethtrader users\\\/wallets](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p64bti1nk7yb1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=668b8fee1aa0ae565e865f5c82b8bb9b78e6de75)\n\nAs you can see the above is (as I expected) a barbell shape.   We see that over 2500 users that earned CONTRIB and same amount of DONUTs basically have sold AT LEAST 90% of their DONUTs.  Another 1300 or so users pretty much have maintained a DONUT level (at time of this snapshot) of at least 90% of all the CONTRIB they earned.     This shows a significant disparity between two groups of users on \/r\/ethtrader those who have maintained their voting power by holding their DONUTs and those that have sold them all.\n\nThe next question becomes what happens to the above if I filter for current DONUT holders.  So I sorted the to 100 DONUT holders and looked at their Q factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 100 DONUT holders Q factors](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3fka72vcl7yb1.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3710afdf2a853dbd131c3468e2f7530aaa18b67)\n\nHere we see that over 50% of the top 100 DONUT holders have maintained a Q factor of 11.  Meaning they have sold less than 10% of all the DONUTs relative to their total CONTRIB.  Maintaining a high voting power relative to their maximum voting power.   These are DONUT holders.  You can see that about 80% of top 100 DONUT holders hold DONUTs corresponding to over 1\/2 ALL the DONUTs they earned.\n\nNow lets look at the top 100 CONTRIB holders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 100 CONTRIB holders Q factors](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dd2yh8qul7yb1.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=2461d0120287e09715bf9bf7d8b499046c152bd3)\n\nHere we see that 75% of top 100 CONTRIB holders have sold 90% of more of all the DONUTs they earned.\n\nThis my fellow \/r\/ethtrader posters\/contributors is a distinct tale of two users groups.\n\n1)   High Q factor users:  These are highly active significant DONUT earners and DONUT holders but may not be the highest CONTRIB earners.  These tend to be highly active and productive community members who are showing a long term commitment to the sub and community\n\n2)   Low Q factor users:  These are probably the highest activity people, who likely produce the least valuable content that have no long term commitment to the community or the sub.\n\nThe above data DOES NOT include the LP held by users so there may be users with high levels of LP provided that have little DONUTs (this would only skew the committed users upward if adjusted for) and would not really change the picture of the low Q contributors much because I know for a fact there are no more than 20-30 users providing significant LP.\n\nNumbers on the above.\n\nTop 100 CONTRIB users have a combined 28.2M DONUTs and 128M CONTRIB, 27.9M voting weight.\n\nTop 100 DONUT users have a combined 34.4M DONUTs and 60M CONTRIB, for a combined 34.6M voting weight.\n\nI have not looked at the snapshot voting or quorum limits here but it is clear that at some point community (2) will have more voting power than community (1) and we have already passed the level that community (2) would be able to 'buy' DONUTs and hence buy governance should they as a group wanted to force governance decisions.    Right now I don't think there is enough DONUTs in LP to change this.\n\nBased on the above analysis what I want to propose to the community is that we adjust DONUT earnings with the above Q factor.   So say you earned 10K DONUTs this distribution.  If you have a Q factor of 1 - you earn 1K, if you have a Q factor of 10 you earn the full 10K.   I personally think that CONTRIB earned should be capped so that big DONUT farmers can't accumulate governance power by sheer amount of DONUT\/CONTRIB accumulation they are getting.   I also think that the maximum DONUT\/CONTRIB earned should be capped by the amount of time in the sub and we should do daily snapshots of the above to create an average Q factor weight for distribution periods so users can't game the Q factor by selling DONUTs after distribution and buying them back before snapshot is taken.\n\nI still believe that what u\/carlslarson created here governance wise is one of the most unique and valuable models, not just to measure historical contributions, but to also measure value to the community as reflected in governance weight.  To my mind what is unfortunate is that the mods and important members of the community are not looking to leverage the dual token model into something that produces significant value and better content for the community so that we could actually quantify our unique user base of visitors (which I estimate at between 200-1000 - not 3M) so we could put a real numbers on ad views and hence ad value to advertisers.   \n\nI believe a better tracking model would also be useful to reddit generally and could be used to leverage into other subs as u\/LivingFondant1419 has suggested.\n\nA final request.  DO NOT quote this lengthly post and then nominate your post as this was done once before and just illustrates a kind of 'work\/post idea' thievery for the sake of accumulating more DONUTs as the expese of other posters making quality contributions.\n\nThank you in advance for the 10 CONTRIB and 10 DONUTs I will get for the above analysis and real post.

{"selftext":"# Current Situation\n\nIt is no secret that this community uses a Donut-based reward system, to encourage engagement and contributions. Some users are excessively spamming comments, often exceeding **100** or even **200** comments in a day. Most of them are posted in the Daily General Discussion thread and have empty, generic and unnecessary content.\n\nThe excessive commenting, while increasing traffic, is negatively impacting the overall quality of discussions in the community. This makes it difficult for those who want to look for higher quality content and engage in more serious discussions.\n\n# Problem\n\nThe high volume of comments per individual disrupts the user experience and makes it challenging for users to find and engage in high-quality discussions. This excessive spamming also potentially dilutes the value and impact of r\/ethtrader.\n\n# Solution\n\nI recommend we introduce a Pay2Comment fee to mitigate spam and maintain the quality of discussions within the community.\n\nThe fee would work according to the following guidelines:\n\n* Users are allowed to post **up to** 50 comments in a 24-hour period without getting any penalty\n\n* After posting 50 comments, each additional comment will pay a fee of 100 Donuts\n\n* The fee is deducted from the user's share of the distribution, for each comment exceeding the initial 50 (every 24 hours)\n\nExample:\n\n* If someone posts 49 comments a day, there will be no reduction in the distribution\n\n* If someone posts 50 comments a day, the same stands\n\n* If someone posts 51 comments a day, there will be a reduction of 100 Donuts per day in the distribution\n\n* If someone posts 100 comments a day, there will be a reduction of 5000 Donuts per day in the distribution\n\n*Note: In order not to make this penalty too heavy, I recommend that the values \u200b\u200bdo not stack, maintaining a reduction of 100 Donuts per additional comment, within the 24 hour period.*\n\n# Pros\n\n* Reduces spam: The Pay2Comment fee will dissuade users from excessive commenting, helping to reduce spam and improve the overall quality of discussions\n\n* Encourages thoughtful contributions: Users will be encouraged to make meaningful, quality comments instead of spamming for Donuts\n\n* Sustainable Donut system: Implementing the fee ensures that heavy spammers don't have any more CONTRIB than they're supposed to, preventing any manipulation in important governance decisions\n\n# Cons\n\n* Initial resistance: Some users may resist the change, as they have become accustomed to spamming comments for Donuts\n\n* Less user engagement: There may be concerns that the fee could discourage some users from participating, potentially reducing overall community engagement.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis thread proposes a solution to address the issue of spam comments in the r\/ethtrader community, by introducing a Pay2Comment fee after 50 comments a day. The pros and cons are important considerations for the community to weigh when deciding on the implementation of this change.\n\nIt is possible to change the value of the Pay2Comment fee, if the community so wishes. It is also possible to add a cap to the penalty if the community wishes to do so. It is also possible to increase the daily \"free\" comments.\n\nThis thread will allow the community to voice their opinions and share their concerns. If we reach a consensus it will move on to a governance poll.\n\nThe choices are:\n\n[YES] Introduce a Pay2Comment fee, to be applied after 50 daily comments\n\n[NO] Nothing changes\n\n*This proposal will remain up for a minimum of 2 days, according to the [governance rules & guidelines](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/wiki\/governance\/). This proposal requires 2 moderators to sign it off in order to proceed to a governance snapshot vote.*","title":"[Poll Proposal] Introduce a Pay2Comment fee, to be applied after 50 daily comments","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699053136,"id":"17n7v62"}

{"selftext":"This post was inspired by  [**u\/kirtash93**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/kirtash93\/) [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17mqpjk\/ethereum_founders_charles_hoskinson\/) on a series about the Ethereum Founders. Originally the contents from this post was originally from the r\/CointestOfficial sub but I thought it would be nice to share some knowledge especially crypto-related information and also discuss with each other on the comments. If you have any additional trivia or opinions please comment down below!\n\nCharles Hoskinson is the founder of Cardano, co-founder of Input Output Global, Inc.  and also a former co-founder of Ethereum. He is currently socially active in his Youtube channel and Twitter account, discussing his views and opinions mostly on crypto and blockchain technology. ([1](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charles_Hoskinson)).\n\n**Bizarre Claims**\n\n* From claiming to be some sort of CIA agent, *the* Satoshi Nakamoto, or some ladies' man to explaining to other people how he got his limp from jumping out of Apache helicopters or that he lied about his educational background, Charles has had his fair share of bizarre statements. His previous co-founders have stated how he is some sort pathological liar and a sociopath. Laura Shin, a crypto author, exposed Charles on lying about his PhD where in fact he never even really finished college. These various informations makes it hard to believe that it's all just a personal attack on Charles since his pattern of behavior has become too apparent for people to not see which may or may not make Charles a less desirable figure contrary to what his followers see him. ([1](https:\/\/medium.com\/yardcouch-com\/why-charles-hoskinson-was-shamefully-kicked-out-of-ethereum-8b29faa5cd14), [2](https:\/\/www.wiley.com\/en-ie\/Out+of+the+Ether:+The+Amazing+Story+of+Ethereum+and+the+$55+Million+Heist+that+Almost+Destroyed+It+All-p-9781119602934), [3](https:\/\/twitter.com\/laurashin\/status\/1500556969886760963))\n\n**Inherent Tribalism**\n\n* Charles, being the founder of Cardano, is naturally criticized by other people in the space for being too dogmatic with regards to his project. He even went as far to say on video that he was previously a part of Bitcoin and left due to it not being what he envisioned crypto to be, same goes for Ethereum and accordingly, Charles sees Cardano as the solution to what both crypto giants lack as do most Crypto CEOs and founders these days. ([1](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shorts\/HK986kFf5F8))\n\n**Youtube Channel and the Congressional Hearing**\n\n* Charles is currently active in his youtube channel, engaging in various topics such as crypto, blockchain technology, politics, and philosophy. Two or three videos of him will give a person the idea that Charles is mostly laid back and frank with his opinions and views. His youtube videos are mostly unedited and unscripted giving some people some general comfort in sensing the genuineness of his videos and live streams. ([1](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@charleshoskinsoncrypto))\n* Last year, Charles represented the crypto community in a congressional hearing with the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture, Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit. In the video, Charles gave a relaxed yet respectful speech. He cited the importance of a balanced regulatory framework for crypto while still giving the freedom and innovation needed for growth. Looking outside his questionable actions in the past, Charles was really advocating for Crypto with great articulation and manner. This impressed a lot of people and even those who have criticized him in the past. ([1](https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/cardano-founder-steals-the-show-at-congressional-hearing-on-crypto-regulation\/), [2](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FTD_0b8K5RA))\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n* While Charles isn't the most well-known crypto personality, especially given his political beliefs and prior behavioral difficulties, it's important mentioning that he IS for crypto and will continue to be so. Everyone has imperfections, but they do not define you as a person. I believe Charles has a future in crypto, especially given how devoted he is to advocating for the space.","title":"Charles Hoskinson: Facts and Opinions about the Man","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699086382,"id":"17nh60e"}

Then, once the transfer is done - bridge from Scroll back to Ethereum network. (Note you have to manually claim the Eth on the Mainnet after that, wait til Gwei is low)\n\nStep 2: Deploy Contract: Scroll team has announced deploying a smart contract on Scroll will make you eligible for a Scroll NFT in December, serving as evidence you are an early adopter.\n\nGo to minter.merkly.com\/deploy\/empty and deploy a smart contract to Scroll (thanks u\/OldDomainer for this tip!). Once you are done, you can check if you are eligible for the NFT on the scroll.io official page.\n\nAdditional tips (after the 2 steps above are done):\n\n1) The bridging from Mainnet actually has high fees, but you should do it on scroll.io official bridge at least once. After that, you can go to other sites like Orbiter.finance and bridge between different Layer 2 and scroll - it\u2019s much cheaper !\n\n2) Try to do 1) at least once a week, so the Scroll blockchain records you as doing transactions across multiple weeks.

{"selftext":"Hello, ethtrader community!\n\nWe've been having some exciting discussions on our discord channel, and a couple of intriguing ideas have come up. We'd like to bring these ideas to the entire community to get your feedback and thoughts.\n\n**The Ideas:**\n\n**1. User Tags for Voting:**\n\n* Some members of our community have suggested using tags like !upvote and !downvote for people to indicate their votes on posts and comments.\n* The rationale behind this is that we can mine the comments that use these tags to obtain precise information on upvotes and downvotes.\n* This data can be used to calculate individual karma and can be subjected to a Benford analysis to help identify coordinated voting activities and potentially uncover post farmers and karma miners.\n\n**2. Emoji-Based Voting:**\n\n* Another interesting proposal involves adding special emojis for upvoting and downvoting on ethtrader.\n* The emojis used would indicate your vote on a post or comment.\n* The emoji selected would affect the parent comment or post. If the parent is a comment, the comment gets downvoted\/upvoted, and if the parent is the post, the post gets downvoted\/upvoted.\n* The data from these emojis can be mined for analysis purposes.\n\n**How This Benefits Our Community:**\n\n* These changes could potentially streamline the voting process and provide us with more precise and useful data.\n* Having better voting data can help us to oversee the DONUT farming  and identify coordinated karma manipulation.\n\n**Your Input Matters:**\n\nWe value your opinions and input on these ideas. Do you believe these proposals have merit? Would you prefer one over the other, or perhaps a combination of both?\n\n**Alternative Suggestion:**\n\n* Instead of commenting with tags, we could reply to a stickied comment on a post with !upvote or !downvote to register our votes.\n\n**What's Next:**\n\nThis is a preliminary discussion, and any potential changes would be subject to the consensus of our community and the moderation team. Your feedback is instrumental in shaping the future of our subreddit.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and concerns in the comments below. \n\nFeel free to adapt and post this draft to initiate the discussion.","title":"[DISCUSSION] Proposed Change: Comment2Vote System for r\/ethtrader","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699092627,"id":"17nijmn"}

{"selftext":"*Disclaimer: Use only centralized exchanges for their intended purposes. This post was* [*originally*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CointestOfficial\/comments\/z9o0rc\/comment\/j8mpg0g\/) *from the* r\/CointestOfficial *and is intended for educational purposes only. Have fun and please provide discussions and opinions in the comments!*\n\nA CEX, or Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange, is a business or platform that allows users to own, send, receive, and trade cryptocurrencies with other assets such as fiat, digital assets, and other cryptocurrencies. The majority of the time, a CEX earns commission through trading fees and, on occasion, withdrawal fees if the exchange allows crypto withdrawals.\n\n# PROs\n\n**Ease of Use**\n\n* One of the most obvious advantages of a centralized exchange is its ease of use in comparison to a DEX (decentralized exchange). In general, you deposit fiat or p2p trade fiat for stablecoins through available payment channels such as credit and debit cards, e-wallets, crypto wallets, and into the CEX of your choice, and then you can trade those stablecoins for the coin you want. Compare that to the more sophisticated and less liquid DEX, where you must have your own wallet, whether hot or cold, and deal with several technological terms and steps to engage in peer-to-peer trading. As more people gain experience dealing with the early technological complexities of crypto, they will most likely gravitate toward exchanges with simpler systems to use and navigate.\n\n**Security Features**\n\n* In addition to the standard requirements of a thoroughly secured exchange, a CEX has unique functions that protect their users, liquidity, and the exchange itself from bad actors or when a mishap occurs within the exchange. There have been numerous instances where a hacker\/scammer decides to cash out their victim's assets, and sometimes they end up withdrawing it through a CEX; if a CEX learns of this, they can either blacklist that address or halt transactions in that specific network\/blockchain, preventing or mitigating the damage caused by the bad actor.  Although some have argued that this plan of action prevents innocent users from fully utilizing the platform's functions, a CEX is primarily focused on platform protection and providing any kind of assistance in locating\/identifying the bad actor\/issue that outweighs the temporary hold or shutdown.\n\n**Multiple Chains\/Networks**\n\n* While this falls under the Ease of Use pro point, it's worth noting in another argument that CEX's are very accessible to the most popular crypto networks. Sending a digital asset from one address to another can be accomplished via any of the numerous networks available to that asset. For example, in Binance, one can send USDT via 9 different networks without having to use the native wallets of each of those networks\/blockchains.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\n* Liquidity is important in a cryptocurrency exchange, just as it is in any other financial market. High liquidity implies lower price volatility, avoids market manipulation, and provides users with faster transaction speeds. These characteristics, in turn, give users confidence and trust in the exchange, increasing its rating and thus introducing more users.

{"selftext":"With recent pump of ETH people keep asking \"when bull run\". Let's have a quick look at market sentiment right now.\n\nIn July Ben Cowen posted this very interesting tweet:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l79bana47iyb1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fab4bf35821ab19a1bb718d7988c0dbf23f6e4b\n\nWhen people get worried, they start Googling, just like crypto related searches do go on a big uptrend just before bull run kicks off.\n\nAnd yesterday he posted this:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/khc0w8v97iyb1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=58b12992fe3208caee6dfa08239f2cf00af16004\n\nWe all know that the past data does not guaranteed future performance, but they also say that history doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes.\n\nu\/kirtash93 had this theory about double dip recession floating around for a while and when I saw that tweet from Ben it got me thinking.\n\nFirst dip was the crazy inflation that swept the globe after covid and Ukraine defending against Russian invasion, which lead to increased wheat and fuel prices. Ukraine being the bread basket of the world seriously impacted markets:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ow8gqsky7iyb1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=bebae402898481b12239cf5f80985d126335d1df\n\nThe second wave seems to have come after the initial shock, markets survived, but they didn't shake it off completely. Countries increased interest rates aggressively around the globe to slow down the inflation, and now they are suffering due to this.\n\nEverything is more expensive, less money in circulation, mortgages are more expensive, people have to cover their mortgages, and they have less disposable income because many are now having to pay often double or more for their house, compared to what they've been paying last year. We may be on a brink of the actual recession starting now. Again, history doesn't always repeat, but it often rhymes.\n\nBut what's more interesting is that despite the price of ETH going up, it doesn't translate to actual Google search increase like it did in the past. The search interest went up from 7 points early October to only 11 points around end of October to drop once again back to around 8 points:\n\n[What is this? Uptick for ants?!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3x8lkx4t8iyb1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=76336a1ac70e8f8f771e2cea3b180fffd9d1f627)\n\nLow global \"ETH\" search means that most probably money doesn't flow from retail investors into ETH. Where does it come from then? Was that small uptick on public Google searches about ETH responsible for the price jumping above $1800 alone? I don't think so. Or was it all caused by existing crypto investors that are already in the game?\n\nTL;DR: Looks like we may be heading towards real recession right now, nothing is guaranteed. Less money in traditional markets and less disposable income means less money flowing into the crypto markets as well. Nobody knows shit about fuck. We have to wait and see.\n\nSources:\n\n[https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/infographics\/how-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-has-further-aggravated-the-global-food-crisis\/#:\\~:text=Prices%20for%20wheat%20were%2058,2022%2C%20prices%20have%20fallen%20further](https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/infographics\/how-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-has-further-aggravated-the-global-food-crisis\/#:~:text=Prices%20for%20wheat%20were%2058,2022%2C%20prices%20have%20fallen%20further).\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/intocryptoverse\/status\/1720960708630688249](https:\/\/twitter.com\/intocryptoverse\/status\/1720960708630688249)\n\n[https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?date=today%205-y&q=ethereum](https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?date=today%205-y&q=ethereum)\n\n&#x200B;","title":"When bull run, you ask?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1699180438,"id":"17o95sh"}

{"selftext":"*Disclaimer: Use only centralized exchanges for their intended purposes. This post was* [*originally*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CointestOfficial\/comments\/z9o0fy\/comment\/j8r3ynn\/) *from the* r\/CointestOfficial *and is intended for educational purposes only. Have fun and please provide discussions and opinions in the comments!*\n\nA CEX, or Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange, is a business or platform that allows users to own, send, receive, and trade cryptocurrencies with other assets such as fiat, digital assets, and other cryptocurrencies. The majority of the time, a CEX earns commission through trading fees and, on occasion, withdrawal fees if the exchange allows crypto withdrawals.\n\n# CONs\n\n**No Custody**\n\n* Once you transfer your assets into a CEX, you relinquish the custody of those assets and only trust the CEX to keep the funds for you. No total control of those assets and in a given scenario where a CEX gets hacked it would be very likely that customers' funds will also be stolen. The strongest example would be the Mt. Gox hack were funds were stolen out of the exchange's hot wallet, leaving customers with empty pockets of their beloved Bitcoins and other assets.\n\n**No True Control**\n\n* Centralized Exchanges are, well, centralized. It's one of it's strengths and weaknesses. In some ways it can be much more convenient and faster than DEXs but that convenience and speed is being traded for the total control of your assets. They can stop withdrawalsor other certain functions at anytime at the push of a button  (not literally) and you'd have to go through customer support or check their announcement on why that happened and when will it be okay to withdraw again. This would even be more stressful if a customer had huge amounts of assets stored in a CEX either by reason of staking or trading and can't anymore just because the exchange has halted some services.\n\n**KYC**\n\n* Although this doesn't apply to all the CEXs available, KYC is one that is commonly required by a centralized exchange for you to register or gain access to certain functions\/services within the platform. Not everyone is keen in freely giving out personal information to an exchange especially if there is always a possibility that information might be leaked, stolen, or required by the government institution which might be use against customers against their will. The data\/information might be used by bad actors such as scammers and hackers to steal from customers and\/or use their information to access bank accounts, email accounts, and other privately owned assets.\n\n**Bound by Law**\n\n* One of the things that make a centralized exchange alluring is it's legitimacy and this is because it is bound by the laws of the government of the nation\/country it is operating in. This is also a good thing especially in keeping any employee\/member from the exchange from turning into a bad actor or even the exchange itself as they will be prosecuted if ever but that same government may also use their legal powers to change the way a CEX operates or require them to provide certain documents\/information that would have been considered private such as user information and transactions.\n\n**Requires Trust**\n\n* Centralized Exchanges promise you the idea of fast, secure, and quality services from their platform and you as the customer will have to trust them that they will do what they advertised although most of the time this goes as promised but there will be instances where that trust will be abused. Enter FTX, what once was considered the third largest CEX by volume is now facing a total overhaul due to the exchange facing a liquidity crisis with cases of fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the US and violate campaign finance laws made by their former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Once again abusing customers who only wanted to expose themselves into the crypto market and instead they got scammed. This certain scandal has given crypto and centralized exchanges a bad name and pushed government institutions to be more strict with regards to the regulation of these platforms.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[*https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cryptocurrency\\_exchange*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cryptocurrency_exchange)[*https:\/\/academy.binance.com\/en\/articles\/what-s-the-difference-between-a-cex-and-a-dex*](https:\/\/academy.binance.com\/en\/articles\/what-s-the-difference-between-a-cex-and-a-dex)[*https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/alexandria\/glossary\/centralized-exchange-cex*](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/alexandria\/glossary\/centralized-exchange-cex)\n\n[*https:\/\/blog.wizsec.jp\/2015\/04\/the-missing-mtgox-bitcoins.html*](https:\/\/blog.wizsec.jp\/2015\/04\/the-missing-mtgox-bitcoins.html)\n\n[*https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/11\/11\/business\/ftx-bankruptcy.html*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/11\/11\/business\/ftx-bankruptcy.html)\n\nNotes:  \nThis is the CONS part of this [PROS](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17o62mh\/why_you_should_use_cex_the_pros\/) post.

{"selftext":"Ethereum has suddenly gained on bitcoin with its ratio rising from 0.052 to near 0.054 BTC while its dollar price touched $1,900. That's the highest it has been in four months, with this price rise being due to numerous reasons, some specific to Ethereum.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/uej194zppjyb1.jpg?width=725&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07ccf9f51b08c41c99bc8b875f0dc983972a4931\n\nThe biggest one is probably the Celestia airdrop. That gave circa 170,000 Ethereum users $500 just for being Ethereum users. Many of them probably instantly sold for Ethereum, with the attention that Celestia got during the airdrop earlier this week fading away. That's new demand for Ethereum, with Celestia's market cap currently standing at $330 million. Small, compared to Ethereum's market cap of $228 billion, but potentially enough to move the ratio a bit.\n\nAnother reason is that Ethereum has not kept up with bitcoin, which has gained 30% this month compared to Ethereum's 17%. That has happened in the past when bitcoin led gains, as it did recently due to speculations over the BlackRock spot ETF, but Ethereum usually catches up eventually.\n\nNot least because in this case, if bitcoin gets a spot ETF, then Ethereum will too, as Ethereum futures ETFs have been approved, thus any advantage bitcoin might have would only be temporary. Case in point, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged the Invesco Galaxy spot Ethereum ETF filing this Friday. The deadline for approval or rejection is in May, a few months after bitcoin's January.\n\nAs bitcoin is sort of sideways at resistance ahead of $36,000, numerous cryptocurrencies have seen gains against BTC, with Sol in particular rising 80%. Hence Ethereum's ratio now has its turn too, at least for the day.\n\nThe Devconnect week-long Ethereum gathering in Turkey is almost here as well, starting on the 13th of November. Ethereum is not holding a Devcon this year, with the Devconnect being different in that it is more coders focused. However, as there won't be a Devcon, this Devconnect is kind of Ethereum's main event for the year. Its schedule is packed for the week, with way too much happening. Whether that will affect the price remains to be seen. There may well be announcements, though the event hasn't quite been hyped by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAll three in combination have given Ethereum some strength for the day, but on the downside, bitcoin might be benefiting from the macro picture as well, and Ethereum is back to inflationary for the day. Its supply rose by 0.16% this quiet Sunday, but for the week, it is down by 0.005%. Making it a mixed picture as some Ethereum usage tries to transition to second layers.\n\nOverall, touching $1,900 is a positive sign that Ethereum might be looking to break resistance at $2,000. It will probably do so together with bitcoin if they manage to overtake the resistance levels, so Ethereum might trade sideways as well under that level.  \n\n\nSource (Credits: Trustnode)  \n[https:\/\/www.trustnodes.com\/2023\/11\/05\/ethereum-touches-1900](https:\/\/www.trustnodes.com\/2023\/11\/05\/ethereum-touches-1900)","title":"Ethereum Touches $1900, the highest it has been in four months","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699197273,"id":"17oe0eo"}

{"selftext":"The crypto market is going through a series of phases that will determine the fate of many altcoins. These phases are not random, but rather follow a pattern that can be predicted and exploited by savvy investors. \n\nThis post will explain the five phases of the altcoin season and how to navigate them successfully.\n\n**Phase 1: The Skepticism Surge**\n\nWe are currently in the second phase of the altcoin season, where Bitcoin is leading the market and breaking new highs. However, most people in the crypto space are still doubtful about the sustainability of this rally. They are hoping for Bitcoin to drop below $25K so they can buy more coins, just like they wanted a $10K price in the previous months. They have missed the whole trend and are now looking for entry points.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the coins that had their first leg up during the genesis phase have reached new cycle highs and are showing positive signs of a continuous rally. These coins are the ones that have strong fundamentals and on-chain growth, such as DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse, and Web3 projects. Those who have been tracking these metrics have positioned themselves to profit. These individuals will likely outperform everyone in the upcoming bull market.\n\nOn-chain and fundamental analysis can be a superpower in the crypto market. Once you know how to do it correctly, you can consistently win, even in a bear market. You can use platforms like Arkham, Token Terminal, DeFiLlama, etc., to get insights into the performance and potential of different crypto projects.\n\n**Phase 2: The Bitcoin Breakout**\n\nWe will enter the third phase of the altcoin season when Bitcoin breaks the first psychological level of $50K in the coming weeks. This will trigger a massive FOMO among the masses, who will rush to buy Bitcoin at any price. Alts will start seeing some correction after that, as money flows out of them and into Bitcoin. Bitcoin might go on a wild run, possibly hitting its all-time high sooner than expected.\n\nThis phase will be challenging for altcoin holders, as they will see their portfolios shrink in value. However, this is not the time to panic or sell. This is the time to accumulate more alts at a discount, especially the ones that have proven themselves in the previous phases. These alts will bounce back stronger than ever once Bitcoin finds its top.\n\n**Phase 3: The Ethereum Explosion**\n\nOnce Bitcoin finds its top, Ethereum will begin to outperform the market, and the altcoin market will become very dynamic. Ethereum is the backbone of the crypto ecosystem, and it hosts most of the innovative projects that are driving the adoption and innovation in the space. Ethereum will also benefit from its upcoming upgrades, such as EIP-1559 and ETH 2.0, which will improve its scalability, security, and usability.\n\nMoney will start flowing into different crypto narratives again, such as DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse, Web3, etc. Some of these narratives will outperform the market, and some will lag behind. However, some people will still complain that their bags aren't moving because they haven't evolved; they are still holding old bags of ghost projects. Cryptocurrency projects with better tokenomics, on-chain growth, and a strong flywheel will outperform the market. Those who understand how to use on-chain analysis platforms will likely see significant returns.\n\n**Phase 4: The Euphoria Peak**\n\nThe fourth phase will be euphoric, with the masses entering the crypto market again. Most of the money will flow into simpler investments, meme coins, and low-quality coins. This is the phase where everyone feels like a genius, and the media is full of hype and FUD. This is also the phase where most of the scams and hacks happen, as people are less careful and more greedy.\n\nThis is the best time to start taking profits, because the euphoric phase is the shortest phase of the altcoin season, and it rarely ends well. This is the time to be cautious and selective, and to avoid FOMO and FUD. This is the time to preserve your capital and prepare for the next cycle.\n\n**Phase 5: The Doom Crash**\n\nThe fifth phase is the doomed phase, where the market crashes again, new bagholders are born, cryptocurrencies are declared as scams again, and generational wealth is lost once more. This is the phase where most people lose hope and faith in the crypto market, and where the smart money accumulates more coins at a bargain. This is the phase where the cycle repeats itself, and where the next altcoin season begins.\n\nTL;DR: \n\nThe altcoin season is not a random or unpredictable phenomenon, but rather a cyclical and patterned process that can be understood and exploited by savvy investors.\n\nBy knowing the different phases of the altcoin season and how to navigate them, you can increase your chances of success and avoid the pitfalls of the crypto market. \n\nRemember, the crypto market is not a sprint, but a marathon. The winners are not those who chase the hype, but those who follow the fundamentals.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hmalviya9\/status\/1721504092185629158?t=JdvS46Gzu8sgcb4uRlbzWg&s=19)","title":"How to Catch the Altcoin Wave - We Are in Phase 2 now!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699277606,"id":"17p2try"}

Fortunately, the industry has recovered from the bearish market, and specifically, the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry has bounced back.\n\nMyriad factors are contributing to Ethereum\u2019s overall uptick, which includes economic recuperation, a market rally, and even social dominance. At present, Ether\u2019s uptick is arguably catalyzed by the market valuation of its decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens.\n\nDEX tokens have $9.93 billion in market capitalization and $1.60 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Moreover, DefiLlama shows that the total locked volume of ETH is rapidly rising at $23.8 billion, with Uniswap being the best player in terms of TVL and Pancakeswap ranking first via volume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ws32nrxzcqyb1.jpg?width=2499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc6c72390e389a1cfd79acb0aa6208fb6f374efc)\n\nSimultaneously, Uniswap, a well-reputed DEX, proves its mettle as it tops the TVL ranking at the time of this writing. This ERC-20 token-friendly exchange platform is known for leveraging the Automated Market Maker model to revolutionize token swaps.\n\nThe TVL of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s native token, is now at $3.01 billion.

The swell in market valuation comes immediately after the introduction of a new feature on its platform called Position Manager.\n\nThe newly launched tool lets users deposit funds into a vault, which are then automatically allocated to liquidity pools for yield farming. CAKE\u2019s TVL is presently at $61.82 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $343.83 million and a $550.71 million market cap.\n\n[Source and Credits](https:\/\/coinedition.com\/ethereum-dex-volume-at-9-93-billion-pancakeswap-and-uniswap-in-focus\/)\n\n&#x200B;","title":"Ethereum DEX Volume at $9.93 Billion; PancakeSwap and Uniswap in Focus","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699278011,"id":"17p2yao"}

{"selftext":" Despite facing criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress, Gensler's SEC, with a strong push from the Biden administration, pursued an aggressive stance against crypto. This arguably played a role in halting Reddit's groundbreaking Community Points (RCP) program.\n\nWhat's significant:\n\n* Reddit was primed to roll out the RCP program, which would've revolutionized community interaction and offered a unique revenue-sharing model.\n* Their comprehensive documentation detailed how RCPs would work: [Reddit RCP Documentation](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20230320194142\/https:\/\/reddit.com\/community-points\/documentation\/developers).\n* During a call with RCP mods, it was expressed that regulatory risks associated with the SEC had become a significant concern for Reddit, and it stands to reason that the SEC's recent anti-crypto stance, combined with Reddit aiming for public trading status, played into that.\n\nBy stalling projects like the RCP program, we miss opportunities to uplift countless individuals. The below screenshot, of a comment by a user in El Salvador, highlights the potential impact of such programs in developing countries.\n\nThe moral of these events is that there are tragic real world consequences in stifling innovation in the pursuit of political agendas.\n\n   \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qpkykcs0sqyb1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=95aa401e329c84b35973f97c2660e991f81522c0","title":"This is what Gary Gensler's SEC, with the backing of the Democratic Party's leadership, put an end to.

{"selftext":"In Fall 2021, the US Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) amidst significant backlash from the public. The package contained some deeply misguided provisions addressing cryptocurrency that threatened software developers trying to create alternatives to Big Banks and Big Tech. We at Fight for the Future led much of the opposition through our viral campaign at [dontkillcrypto.com](http:\/\/www.dontkillcrypto.com\/) and now we\u2019re ready to fight its implementation.\n\nAlmost two years later on August 29, the US Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [published](https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy1705) their proposed regulations on the sale and exchange of digital assets by brokers as part of their implementation of the IIJA. This rulemaking will define a \u201cdigital asset\u201d and who qualifies as a \u201cbroker\u201d under the tax code. These new regulations could mandate the mass surveillance of digital assets which would be a massive blow to our human rights.\n\nCompliance with this rule and its reporting requirements would be impossible for some of the people working with this tech. The definition is so broad that it would force developers working on decentralized tech projects to collect info they don't have and certainly don't need.

He got into Bitcoin and it was in a Bitcoin business conference in Amsterdam in September 2013 when he met Vitalik.\n\nAmir, at the time he met Vitalik was working with a Israeli startup Colored Coins, a project to manage real world assets as tokens on top of Bitcoin.\n\nIn December 2013 Vitalik asket Amir to join him.\n\n# Role\n\nHe was one of the founders but I have not found exactly what his role was. Anyway, at the co-founders meeting in June 2014, Amir was accused by ETH developers and other co-founders for his lack of input on Ethereum so he agreed to step down while remaining a cofounder.\n\n# After Ethereum\n\nAfter he stepped down he keeps quietly supporting various different blockchain projects, but is very low-profile, and doesn\u2019t like publicity. There is not much info about this guy. I searched and searched and he is anonymous right now.","title":"Ethereum Founders: Amir Chetrit","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699376761,"id":"17pyz4h"}

{"selftext":"=nil; is a zkRollup that securely scales Ethereum to 60,000+ TPS through zkSharding, empowering web3 developers to build scalable, secure, and composable applications. \n\nzkSharding combines zkRollup with sharding to enable parallel transaction processing while maintaining a shared state, effectively scaling the Ethereum network without the typical trade-offs of modularity.\n\nRead this X thread to know more: https:\/\/twitter.com\/nil_foundation\/status\/1721918422198386966?t=qiUXaljNigiqiZnMvBnKcw&s=19","title":"Announcing zkSharding for Ethereum by nil Foundation","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699379767,"id":"17q044y"}
{"selftext":"Nil Foundation's zkSharding redefines Ethereum scalability with an innovative Layer 2 solution, revolutionizing decentralized applications.\n\nThe Nil Foundation has launched a pioneering ZK-Rollup Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, boasting sharding capabilities designed to revolutionize the scalability of decentralized applications. This strategic development heralds a new chapter in the Ethereum network\u2019s evolution, promising to elevate performance by merging multiple shards into a seamless execution layer.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Scalability Leap with Sharding Integration\nAt the heart of this innovation is the integration of sharding technology within a Layer 2 framework, an approach set to transform how decentralized applications operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Misha Komarov, the CEO and co-founder of Nil Foundation, expresses excitement about this launch: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to roll out zkSharding to Ethereum\u2019s vibrant developer community, paving the way for high-load and data-rich applications to thrive on the platform.\u201d\n\nSharding is familiar to Ethereum\u2019s scalability conversation since it is a core component of the network\u2019s strategic blueprint, enabling concurrent transaction processing and boosting throughput. Consequently, the Nil Foundation\u2019s zkSharding is not merely an addition but a critical evolution. It harmonizes the primary shard, where transactions gain verification through robust zero-knowledge proofs, with auxiliary shards that amplify the system\u2019s capacity to handle transactions.\n\nCompeting at the Forefront of DeFi\n\nWith this move, Nil, formerly known for its innovative-proof marketplace, steps boldly into a competitive arena. It stands shoulder-to-shoulder with ventures like Polygon zkEVM, zkSync, and Scroll. This strategic pivot follows a successful funding initiative, which saw the foundation bolster its resources with a $22 million investment led by Polychain Capital in January.\n\nMoreover, the integration of zkSharding is more than a technical upgrade since it is a beacon of scalability, inviting developers to imagine and realize a future where Ethereum\u2019s potential is unbounded. The Nil Foundation\u2019s commitment to facilitating decentralized sequencers, programmable data solutions, exchanges, and more within Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem is not just significant but also revolutionary.","title":"Nil Foundation Revolutionizes Ethereum with ZK-Rollup Sharding","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699381183,"id":"17q0nji"}

{"selftext":"Based on two approved proposals, I would like to introduce to you donut-bot.  The bot currently  consists of two modules, one focused on registering wallets for distribution and the other with a focus on tipping.\n\n# Register Bot\n\nBased on [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/ogugf9\/comment\/k6m4iuw\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) proposal, this process will aide with a frictionless user registration. The following commands are valid:\n\n**!register status** \\- show the status of the current user. It will report back to you the wallet address you have on file - or it will inform you that you are not registered.\n\n**!register <address>** \\- will update the address on file to the supplied address, or respond with an error message (e.g. invalid address format) in the event of an error.\n\n**!register {your ens address}.eth** \\- You are also able to supply ENS addresses as well! We will perform a live lookup when the address is needed (e.g. - At distribution time) to ensure we always use the most recent address. Your address must resolve at time of database insert, otherwise the registration will fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tip Bot - (Earn2Tip)\n\nBased on [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/ogugf9\/comment\/k6kumoh\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) proposal.  Similar to the mechanics of Pay2Post - the tips will be deducted from the users earnings at the end of the distribution round. The tipper must be registered prior to sending tips. The receiver must be registered in order to receive tips, but does not need to be registered to be tipped (the tips will sit in a pool waiting for the user to register).\n\n***Please note that the tip being sent is conditional on the tipper earning enough donuts for the month. If a user tips more than they have earned for the round, no tip will be materialized. For example, if a user tips 200 donut in a round but only earns 50 donut, only the first 50 donut will be honored. All tips after that will be discarded.***\n\nTo invoke earn2tip, you can use the following commands:\n\n**!tip sub** \\- Shows high level activity of tip count and total for the current sub, as well as listing the available tokens (and which is default) for this sub.\n\n**!tip <amount>** \\- tip using the default token for the sub. This can be in a multiline comment.\n\n**!tip <amount> <token>** \\- specify which coin\/token you want to tip. This can be in a multiline comment.\n\n**!tip status** \\- will show the total amount of earn2tips sent and received for the user in the current round.\n\n**!tip** \\- the fallback (or if a user prefers to do onchain tips) - will create links to donut.finance to perform on-chain tips.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions:**\n\n**Q:** What format should the <amount> be in?\n\n**A:** The amount should not contain any commas (,). This means that commas should not be in the amount to seperate groups nor should commas be used to specify a decimal number.\n\nThe following are **VALID** amounts: 1000 | 1000.10 | .69 | 0.69\n\nThe following are **INVALID** amounts: 1,000 | 0,69\n\nIn addition, any decimal more precise than 5 digits will be rounded to the 5th digit and the integer portion (the part before the decimal) must not be larger than 10 digits long.","title":"Introducing donut-bot - !register and !tip commands now available.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699385024,"id":"17q24e7"}

They already launched one a year ago which we missed. We earned 400 LDO tokens which can be traded basically on every exchange. We continue to farm with more wallets.

{"selftext":"In this recent bear market, I noticed a lot of discussion around various strategies that either helped or caused losses for people.\n\nMy personal approach involved Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) mainly into BTC and ETH, bought some other solid alts at random, and jumped on new narratives, while taking partial profits, I staked on Beefyfinance and SpoolFi.\n\nAlso, I participated in the last meme season, although I didn't follow a specific strategy for that. I essentially bought whatever seemed promising, and fortunately, I managed to make some profit which was a great boost to my pf and the liquidity that I\u2019m holding now.\n\nNow that the market seems to be showing signs of recovery, I\u2019ve shifted towards buying more altcoins compared to the two big boys.

{"selftext":"   \nWe all know that Crypto was built on the foundation of a decentralized, transparent ledger known as the blockchain. This technology undoubtedly offers a transparent and immutable record of all transactions, accessible and verifiable by anyone. While this transparency is appreciated on the blockchain, it has raised concerns about the privacy of individuals and their financial transactions. These concerns have led to the development of privacy protocols.\n\nPrivacy protocols address these concerns and provide users with enhanced ownership and security. However, there was a concern. As privacy projects continue to evolve, regulatory concerns have emerged regarding their potential use in facilitating illicit activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and other forms of financial crime. Tornado Cash is a perfect example in this case.\n\nRegulatory authorities have been struggling with the challenge of balancing the need for privacy with the necessity of preventing criminal activities. The intersection of privacy protocols with regulatory compliance has led to debates about the appropriate form of privacy that should be permitted within the crypto space and the perfect way to balance privacy and offer some level of transparency in crypto.\n\nCould Railgun provide the solution to this current dilemma that we face in PriFi? Recently, the privacy protocol launched the private proof of Innocence, and this tech could revolutionize the way individuals perceive privacy projects.\n\nPrivate Proofs of Innocence (Private POI) is a decentralized assurance system built by zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography researchers and contributors to the Railgun Project. Private POI is a tool that gives cryptographic assurance that funds entering the Railgun smart contract are not from a known list of transactions or actors considered undesirable by respective wallet providers. Users create a ZK proof (a small piece of sealed data) that their funds are not part of a pre-set list of transactions and wallets. This process is end-to-end encrypted and enables decentralized and private assurance of funds without compromising user privacy.\n\nPrivate POI sits alongside (but is separate from) the Railgun smart contracts and its open-source infrastructure that can be used by other protocols. This becomes important and useful for users who want to prove that they have not interacted with malicious individuals without having to compromise their privacy.","title":"Peeling Back the Layers: The Blockchain Dilemma\u2014Where Transparency Meets the Shadows of Privacy.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699530039,"id":"17rb35x"}

{"selftext":"Hi all,\n\nI'm the one behind [https:\/\/www.mydonuts.online](https:\/\/www.mydonuts.online). This poll proposal is regarding our next distributions.\n\n# The problem\n\nReddit won't be working with RCPs any longer. Even if DONUT is not an RCP in the fashion of MOON and BRICK, it was also affected: **Reddit is delaying the deliver of the csv file and relying on them to do so might affect how distributions happen**. \n\nWe're half-way through round 130 and data from round 129 has not been released yet.\n\n# The solution\n\nUse the MyDONUTs' algorithms to generate the official csv for the distributions, [as done for round 129](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17puoqh\/mydonuts_csv_has_now_included_pay2post_fees_for\/), **for posts and comments** in the sub. This would start as from round 129 and would replace the file that Reddit used to deliver.\n\n# Pros and cons\n\nBeing able to calculate scores means that anyone can run the routine on their computers and data can be compared later before the distribution is issued.\n\nWith anyone being able to run the algorithm and we not being tied to Reddit's csv anymore, I can't think of any cons, but welcome other takes.\n\n# \"I don't like the data so far and believe there are other options, such as...\"\n\nThen please go forward, implement your solutions and **bring the data and codes so that we can compare and assess its feasibility** and compare to what we already have. \n\n# FAQ\n\n**(1) What changed from Reddit's csv to MyDONUTs' one?**\n\nReddit's csv calculated karma. MyDONUTs' calculates scores, i.e. net upvote number (upvotes-downvotes) in posts and comments. This is retrieved by using Reddit's own API.\n\n**(2) What's the difference between karma and score?**\n\nScore is just upvotes minus downvotes. Karma calculation includes other factors, such as how long it took for the submission to reach this or that amount of upvotes. Only Reddit knows how to calculate karma, and that's why we're going for scores instead.\n\n**(3) Is the code open?**\n\nCodes to process the data are open source, the data harvesting one is waiting for the mod's decision on the incentive proposal before being made public. In the meantime, **anyone can use Reddit's API to write their own scrapper and compare data**. \n\nIn fact, \/u\/TheNano100 has done so and said their data matches MyDONUTs'.\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/17re00e)","title":"[Governance Poll Proposal] Use MyDONUTs' csv generator for upcoming distributions","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699539696,"id":"17re00e"}

I hope this helps you keep track of cryptocurrencies.\n\nI then asked the AI if the service was safe and efficient. \n\nCoinMarketAlert is a service that provides cryptocurrency price alerts and breaking news. \n\n[It is owned and operated by Coin Market Group, a company based in Switzerland and a member of Crypto Valley Switzerland](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/)[1](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/). [The service has received mostly positive reviews from customers who have used it, with a 3.8 out of 5 rating on Trustpilot](https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/coinmarketalert.com)[2](https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/coinmarketalert.com). Some of the benefits that customers have mentioned are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The alerts are easy to use and      customize\n* The alerts are prompt and accurate\n* The service helps to make profits and prevent      losses by swing trading\n* The service offers various notification      methods and frequencies\n* The service covers a wide range of      coins, conditions, and events\n\nHowever, some of the drawbacks that customers have reported are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The service sometimes sends spam emails      or notifications\n* The service sometimes has technical      issues or glitches\n* The service sometimes has delays or      errors in the alerts\n* The service sometimes has poor customer      support or communication\n\nBased on this information, CoinMarketAlert seems to be a safe and reliable service for most users, but it may also have some room for improvement. Ultimately, the decision to use it depends on your personal preferences and needs.\n\nThe cost for using CoinMarketAlert depends on the plan you choose. There are three pricing options available:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Free Trial**: You can use the service for free for 15 days with unlimited      access to all features, such as portfolio tracker, price alerts,      notification APIs, and more. [You need to register      with the code CMA15 to start the free trial](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/pricing\/)[1](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/pricing\/).\n* [**Yearly**: You can pay $99 per year to      get all the features of the free trial, plus first access to upcoming      features and the ability to publish articles on the site blog](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/pricing\/)[1](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/pricing\/).\n* **Enterprise**: You can pay $49 per year per account (minimum 15 accounts) to      provide CMA services to your entire company or community. [This is ideal for      portfolio managers and any other investment businesses](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/pricing\/)[1](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/pricing\/).\n\nAdditionally, you can also own a Crypto Alerting NFT, which gives you a lifetime subscription to all existing and future CMA services. This includes current and future access to all the perks and utilities. [The NFT costs 0.1 ETH to mint](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/pricing\/)[1](https:\/\/coinmarketalert.com\/pricing\/).\n\nI am interested in signing up to the free service and trying out the alerts. Really interested in getting alerts when an Exchange makes a new listing. is $99 to much to pay for an alert system ??.  \n\nHas anyone used any services like these or is considering using such a service.

{"selftext":"Some common talking points used against ETH, and my responses to them:\n\n**1. Ethereum's monetary policy changes every year at the whim of the developers.**\n\nAs for Ethereum's monetary policy, since the Merge, it has been finalized:\n\nIt has a dynamic issuance rate that is algorithmically determined by the percentage of the money supply used for staking. That rate ranges from 0.17%, if only 1 million ETH is staked, to 1.57%, if 100 million ETH is staked.\n\nThere is also a burn rate, based on the transaction fees paid, which in turned are determined by how much block space Ethereum has, and what the demand for that block space is. So the net issuance rate can be negative with enough transaction fees.\n\nSo we know roughly what the supply curve of ETH will be. We don't know exactly what it will be because it's a real asset, that is governed by real world forces, and not a gimmick. And we know exactly what algorithm and economic forces will govern the supply curve, because it's immutably encoded in the protocol.\n\n**2. Ethereum proved it is centralized when the devs decided to undo the DAO hack, because they stood to lose the ETH they had put into the DAO** \n\nThere were lengthy community discussions and then a hard fork that undid the hack, so every Ethereum stakeholder had a stay in whether they would support the DAO fix.\n\nVitalik had on the order of 2% of his ETH in the DAO. The Parity multisig malfunction froze the entire treasury of a company founded by Gavin Wood, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, and that was never rolled back.\n\nThe DAO was the single case of social consensus overriding the protocol in Ethereum, and that was a very extraordinary event that occurred under very unique and unrepeatable circumstances.\n\ni. Ethereum had just launched. There was a sense of everything being in beta.\n\nii. The Ethereum stakeholder set was very small, so obtaining consensus for such a controversial hard fork was much easier to accomplish than it would be today.\n\niii. The economy on Ethereum was very small, so\n\na) a hard fork was far less disruptive than it would be today.\n\nb) an undermining of Ethereum's commitment to neutrality\/immutability jeapardized far fewer decentralized application projects than it would today.\n\niv. smart contracts were completely new, so there was a sense that people could be forgiven for their mistakes.\n\nThere have been smart contract malfunctions involving larger sums of value since the DAO, and none of them came close to resulting in a hard fork.\n\n**3. Ethereum failed at scaling, because it requires users to use Layer 2, instead of letting them stay on Layer 1**\n\nL2 is a fundamentally better way to scale. The term L2 may be a bit misleading, as it implies it's entirely on a different layer. Layer 2s in fact publish all consensus-critical state changes and state to L1, allowing their entire record of transactions to be fully reconstructed entirely from L1 data.\n\nThis makes it possible to make them just as decentralized and secure as any L1 application.\n\nL2s have the added advantage of massively reducing the computational resources that L1 nodes use to process each transaction. It's simply the most efficient way to process transactions without trusted third parties. In other words, Ethereum is pursuing the best scaling strategy thus conceived of, and is the only game in town when it comes to that scaling strategy.\n\nAuthor: u\/aminok\n\n[Link](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17si5m7\/daily_general_discussion_november_11_2023_utc0\/k8t2jhc\/)","title":"[DD Nominated Comment] Some common talking points used against ETH, and my responses to them: **1.

{"selftext":"Hey r\/EthTrader! Today, I want to explore an exciting idea:\n\n    Could Ethereum become the go-to currency for AI agents in the future? Let's dive into this!\n\n## Why Ethereum and AI Could be Perfect Together\n\nI've been contemplating the evolving role of ETH and its potential future use cases, particularly in relation to AI agents.\n\nAI agents are advanced artificial intelligence programs designed to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These agents operate autonomously within their designed parameters, continuously learning and adapting to new data.\n\nETH, with its digital, decentralized nature, seems like a natural fit for AI agents. Unlike traditional money, which exists in a physical and heavily regulated environment, Ethereum is part of the digital world - the same world where AI operates. This shared digital space makes ETH an ideal match for AI agents.\n\nOne fascinating aspect is how Ethereum's smart contracts could empower AI. These are like digital agreements written in code, enabling AI to carry out secure, self-executing transactions. Imagine AI agents using Ethereum to automatically manage tasks, negotiate deals, pay salaries, or even create new smart contracts for specific purposes. This level of autonomy could revolutionize how AI functions and interacts.\n\nSecurity is another key factor. Ethereum's blockchain technology provides a level of security and transparency that's crucial for AI operations. It ensures that AI transactions are safe and traceable, which is essential for building trust in these new digital interactions.\n\nThe implications for us as EthTraders are intriguing. AI agents using Ethereum could lead to:\n\n* Increased demand for ETH.\n* More activity and liquidity in the markets.\n* New trading patterns driven by AI decision-making.\n* Wider use of smart contracts, possibly creating new market opportunities.\n\n## Implications and Possibilities\n\nAs we delve deeper into this digital age, the inevitable synergy between AI and Ethereum is not just exciting, it's transformative. This connection opens up vast possibilities for new types of market dynamics, AI-to-AI transactions, and innovative economic models.\n\nThe global reach of ETH, transcending national boundaries, is particularly crucial for AI agents. Whether they operate internationally or within decentralized networks, this universal accessibility ensures that AI systems can function seamlessly across borders. Moreover, the concept of programmable money is a natural fit for AI. Ethereum's ability to program specific conditions and scenarios into transactions perfectly aligns with the needs of AI for flexible, conditional financial mechanisms.\n\nThis opens doors to the possibility of completely automated or AI-managed companies and communities. Imagine a world where micro-tasks, much like the collective efforts we put in as r\/EthTrader members, are coordinated and compensated in crypto. This not only illustrates a future where our collective work as a community is rewarded in real-time but also hints at an economic model where AI-driven systems contribute, manage, and thrive autonomously in a cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThe AI agents becoming significant players in the crypto world, the implications for traders, investors, and the global economy are profound.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yutsoqkt0zzb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b950f5a8ccc30c896b142bdf3a9194618558d57","title":"\ud83c\udf10 Exploring the Future of Crypto: AI Agents and Ethereum \ud83c\udf10","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699818705,"id":"17ts3f3"}

This doesn't just provide value through token appreciation but also through passive income, which serves as a real yield system.\n\nThe concept as of now basically started with real world estate but has branched out into other endeavors of life due to the fast development of the global economy and traction around technology. In the context of the economy of things, this allows users to tokenize any sort of connected machine, vehicle, robot, or device for passive income.

Asset tokenization is a real big deal. It does not just simplify how assets are owned, managed, and transferred but also makes finance more inclusive.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf this aspect continues at this pace, I think it's poised to emerge as a trend.","title":"Tokenization of Real-World Assets: Could This Be a Game-Changer?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1699959598,"id":"17uzubn"}

{"selftext":"Disclaimer: ([Original source](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/CointestOfficial\/wiki\/cointest_archive)) this post is for *educational purposes* only. Please practice DYOR and have fun discussing your thoughts in the comments below! \n\n**Trustlessness** is generally defined as the state of being trustless (the lack of trust). In the context of cryptocurrency, Trustlessness refers to a system that does not require the participation and\/or involvement of parties with one another nor is it controlled by any individual or entity. This particular principle is one of the many key points and attractions of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies in the space. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f2p3k4j5gb0c1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f810e2c15c6e7a66f5b0cc7f3ad0727c056ff6dd\n\n#  PROs\n\n**Less Involvement, Less Exposure**\n\n* As stated in the introduction to this argument, no participant will require themselves to be directly involved in a transaction, nor will any service expose themselves to their corresponding clients. This system enables its users to disregard the traditional method of simply delegating authority\/power to a single entity\/third party that may pose a threat or risk in the future (e.g., hacks, bad actors, scandals).\n\n**More Independence, More Secure**\n\n* Public-Key Cryptography is one of the components that gives crypto its trustless nature. The concept advocates for the use of public and private keys for both the sender and receiver. This increases security because digital signatures in the form of private keys can never be rejected. However, it should be noted that these private keys should be kept secret in order to prevent unauthorized access to the wallet. A user in the receiving end won't have to trust the sender nor any third-party service to see that a transaction came through, it is all available in the blockchain, from the transactions ID's to the sender's address (public key).\n\n**Trust the Code**\n\n* Rather than relying on other people or organizations to carry out an agreement or transaction, we have a number of consensus, protocols, codes, and smart contracts that can do the \"executing\" for us. These mechanisms do not have the human flaws of corruption or sudden change without the majority of its participants agreeing (machine and governance consensus).\n\n#  CONs\n\n**The Price is Subjectively Heavy**\n\n* In a world where technology is constantly evolving, making it more user-friendly. Crypto users will have to pay the price by being more self-sufficient and vigilant when conducting transactions. Even though most of these interactions are nearly trustless, users must be relied on to make everything correct or the transaction will fail. Most users are already turned off by the relative lack of convenience. They can simply rely on a third-party company to provide the same services with less effort on their part.\n\n**It's not for Everyone**\n\n* While this argument falls under the umbrella of cryptography, it's worth noting that a trustless system isn't for everyone. There will be users who prefer traditional systems\/methods that rely on the interaction\/communication of two living beings. Most of these people will figure out how overly complicated cryptography works (along with the added inconvenience of having to keep your private keys) and the simpler methods of trusting people to do the job rather than some mathematical algorithm that adds costs and wastes time for them.\n\n**Code still depends on their Maker**\n\n* There are already a number of consensus, protocols, codes, and smart contracts in crypto that can do the \"executing\" for us rather than the companies providing the same services. While this system appears to be impenetrable to corruption, it does have a flaw: the code's creator. Even if the code is open source, secure, and supported by a large number of users, it is still vulnerable to other risks besides corruption (hacks, 51% attacks, bad governance changes, exploits). To summarize, the code's efficacy is still dependent on humans.\n\nTrustlessness is just one of many systemic methods that can assist humanity in shaping itself into modernity. With less reliance on other people and organizations to trust them that they will do the job, this type of system is not perfect. In fact, it's still a long way off, but reducing trust while increasing autonomy is a big step in the right direction. Bitcoin and Crypto have proven that relying on humans for everything isn't all that difficult, especially if we put our faith more in the code, mechanisms, and everything in between.

It allows off-chain storage of all data and computation, excluding deposits, withdrawals, and Merkle roots. It is being highlighted that Plasma\u2019s approach offers substantial scalability advantages without being constrained by on-chain data availability. However, plasma faced challenges related to large client-side data storage costs and fundamental limitations, leading to its eclipse by rollups. \n\nIn the blog, Vitalik suggest reconsidering Plasma's potential. He shed light on its validity proofs, also known as ZK-SNARKs. He also argues that these proofs can effectively address the hurdles faced by Plasma in payment scenarios. Vitalik particularly showed his concern about client-side data storage.\n\nHe added that validity proofs present a diverse set of tools that could facilitate the development of a Plasma-like chain running an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Buterin believes a substantial percentage of assets could still be securely managed in practice through this revived approach. However, Plasma\u2019s security guarantees may not cover all users due to inherent complexities. \n\n## Can Plasma improve ETH?\n\nVitalik highlights that Plasma is still an underrated design space. He emphasized the Rollups gold standard and its security properties that cannot be matched. However, he concluded by stating that this all comes from the developer experience perspective.\n\nHe informed that ZK-EVMs are finally coming to fruition this year making it an excellent opportunity to re-explore this design space. This could allow them to come up with even more effective constructions to simplify the developer experience and protect users\u2019 funds. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/j231smg03c0c1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=86232032b16558f01dbfab947786929ea867fb71\n\n# What do you think about Plasma?

ETH traded below the $2,050 and $2,000 support levels.\n\nHowever, the bulls were active above the [$1,920 support zone](https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-holds-ground-2000\/). A low was formed near $1,933 and the price is now consolidating losses.

Immediate resistance is near the $2,000 zone.

{"selftext":"Hello, my fellow EthTrader members. At time of writing Moons are at 28 cents, significantly above the price it was at before the rug (22 cents) and even hit 44 cents high on Kraken today.\n\nYou might be wondering now: But that's Moons! How does that affect Donuts, none of our business! \n\nMy personal opinion is very different. In my humble opinion, this is actually very bullish news for the long-term potential of Donuts. And I will explain precisely why in this post:\n\n **1. Moons are here to stay, which means the entire RCPs ecosystem (including Donuts) will survive**\n\nWhether Moon price drops 50% from here, heck even 80%, the value today means one thing - with Reddit out of the way and moon price going even higher, moons are here to stay.\n\nThere were genuine fears Moons were got to 1 cent and towards zero when Reddit first rugged, now clearly this will not happen as there are no more 'black swan' events to rug moons with Reddit already pressing the nuclear button. What this means for Donuts: **RCP ecosystem is healthy and well, and Donuts will not be 'dragged down' as a result.**\n\n**2.  CEXes, especially those that listed Moons and Bricks will continue to look at listing other RCPs like Donuts as a viable option**\n\nWith Moons retaining (or even gaining) its value, and trading volumes being healthy - this means CEX will not delist Moons as initially feared. The **CEXes will not be adverse to listing other community points like Donuts** (which would be a genuine concern, if they all started delisting Moons\/Bricks) if they continue to let Moons stay on their exchange. \\*wink wink Kraken and Donuts\\*\n\n**3. The increase in value of Moons show that community points don't need Reddit to survive**\n\nThe key word is 'survive', so even if Moons drop 80% to 5-10 cents the point still remains - it isn't going to zero. This is good for Donuts for 2 reasons: 1) It affirms our 'DCP' model that a community point does not need Reddit and 2) **It supports point 2 above** \\- CEXes will see community points continue to do well without Reddit, which means **Donuts which is the biggest community point not listed yet will remain an attractive potential listing option**\n\n**4.  Moons having a mega 300% pump in 2 days brings mainstream news and CEX attention to Reddit community points ecosystem, where Donuts is the 'Decentralised CP' OG of**\n\nWe've seen some news articles on this. Kraken\/ and other big CEXes will have no doubt taken note of big moon pump and Kraken even tweeted.\n\nThis sort of hype can only be good for Donuts - because it draws more attention of CEX to listing other potential community points**.** And as mentioned earlier, **which is the biggest community point not listed yet... Ah DONUTS!!** And of course, **Kraken also made a reply on EthTrader just yesterday - they are watching Moons, and watching Donuts as well \ud83d\udc40**\n\n**5.  Donuts being OG- Donut model was what Moon\/Reddit first tried to copy, and now that Moons are DCP people also know Donuts were the OG DCP**\n\nDonuts is the OG of the decentralised model Moons are trying to move towards. When Moons do well, this is also an affirmation that our decentralised model works - our market cap may not be anywhere near Moons, but **the fact that a coin that is trying to model itself after Donuts can do so well without any Reddit support is an affirmation for the mechanics of Donuts.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAnd there you have it folks, my 5 main points on why the Moons news recently is great news for the long-term potential of Donuts.\n\n**Whatever your feelings on Moons**, and regardless whether you sold the bottom of the Moon Rug and feel sad at the pump (I myself was a victim and sold half my bags there), or you're diamond handing Moons all the way (congrats on juicy profits then) - for me it's clear that **Moons** **gigapump without Reddit = very bullish long-term side-effects for Donuts** for the reasons above.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I am very curious to here your thoughts, whether you agree with me or not. Let's debate in the comments!","title":"Moons have risen above pre-rug price. Why this is very good news for Donuts!

{"selftext":"# Building a Tool for ETHTrader Special Membership\n\nThis morning u\/aminok asked me ([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17vgt6j\/comment\/k9bqkwj\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17vgt6j\/comment\/k9bqkwj\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) if I could build a tool for gather information about the special membership users\n\n> I'd need a json file of all users that have a membership. Could you have a script that periodically outputs that? \n\nI didn't knew if I could do it because I am having some personal issues going on right now so I don't know how much I could help.\n\nHowever, I could find time and build some code to try and build this but I found some issues and difficulties that needs a deeper thought so I come here to ask for help an ideas.\n\n# The problem\n\nTLDR; Etherscan free API has a limit of 5 requests per second so I have to wait 1 sec at least between making more calls. Next upgrade level costs $199\/month LOL\n\nThis problem appears depending the input data I use which I explain in the following table:\n\n|Input|Users quantity|Time|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Round 128 Reddit CSV|675|3-4 min|\n|[https:\/\/ethtrader.github.io\/donut.distribution\/users.json](https:\/\/ethtrader.github.io\/donut.distribution\/users.json)|5064|(5064\/5)\/60 = 17-34 min|\n|[https:\/\/ethtrader.github.io\/donut.distribution\/users.json](https:\/\/ethtrader.github.io\/donut.distribution\/users.json) |4957 removing those with contrib = 0|(4957\/5)\/60 = 33 min |\n|[https:\/\/ethtrader.github.io\/donut.distribution\/users.json](https:\/\/ethtrader.github.io\/donut.distribution\/users.json) |2827 removing those with weight = 0|(2827\/5)\/60 = 17.8 min  |\n\nAs you can see even removing the users from the data it is not sustainable for the periodically feature because of the 1-2 seconds I have to wait because of the API Limit.\n\n# My proposed solution is this\n\nBuild a big first json file with all the users (I have to check if I can run the 5064 ones because it crashed before for whatever) and there build an array of json objects like this (more data can be added):\n\n    [{\n        \"username\": \"u\/kirtash93\",\n        \"address\": \"0xa51731189c99832A2ba2f28C6c2dc1Db451F3a2e\",\n        \"activeMembership\": true,\n        \"membershipRank\": 22,\n        \"totalDonutsBurned\": 4400.0,\n        \"totalBoughtMonthsMembership\": 22.0,\n        \"spentDays\": 85,\n        \"notSpentDays\": 584,\n      }]\n\nThen after we have this big file build which will have all the users that has ever bought an special membership we will just reuse it and update it according to the next runs.\n\nHere we will have two different functionalities:\n\n1. The script that periodically checks all the activeMembership = true objects and updates their data accordingly setting the activeMembership to false and updating the other data.\n2. The special membership buy\/extend process that will be on chain and that will add\/update this same file when the process is triggered. Adding a new object if the user is not found and updating it if it already exists. \n\n&#8203;\n\n    {\n        \"username\": \"u\/jack93\",\n        \"address\": \"0xa51731189c99832A2ba2f28C6c2dc1Db451F3a2d\",\n        \"activeMembership\": true\n     }\n\nThe code I have updated is the one just running the round\\_128.csv file. The one loading the big json I have it online and I will push it in another branch when I have more time.\n\nThe code is a fucking mess (first time working on python and getting used to the indents xD)\n\nFeel free to take my code and build whatever you want with it or test it or whatever.\n\nGitHub: [https:\/\/github.com\/kkirtash93\/special-membership-calculator](https:\/\/github.com\/kkirtash93\/special-membership-calculator)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hn2rnkcx4k0c1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=68f6531cc300eeba1ce9d86ba7f7051d19030f33","title":"Building a Tool for ETHTrader Special Membership: Seeking For Feedback","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700074177,"id":"17w0mr3"}

It will launch a platform for buying, selling, and storing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It also plans to educate and advise customers on crypto. It is the first major German bank to get a crypto license from the regulator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb\u00a0El Salvador Remains in the Red on Bitcoin Holdings, But Losses Are Narrowing**\n\nEl Salvador, the first country to make bitcoin legal money, has reduced its losses on its bitcoin from $25 million to $10 million as the price of the crypto goes up. The country bought 700 BTC in September and October, but the value went down as bitcoin fell from over $50,000 to below $40,000. However, as bitcoin rose above $46,000, El Salvador\u2019s losses got smaller. The country plans to buy more bitcoin in the future, despite the ups and downs and criticism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udd2cEthereum Platform Infura\u2019s Step Toward Decentralization Includes Microsoft, Tencent:** \n\nInfura, a service that connects to Ethereum, launches ITX, a project to decentralize its system and governance. ITX lets users delegate transactions to Infura, which optimizes fees and times. ITX has a token, ITX Coin, for payment and voting. Infura teams up with Microsoft, Tencent, and ConsenSys to support ITX. Infura says ITX improves Ethereum\u2019s user experience, scalability, and independence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\u00a0Blockchain Startup Kinto Plans First KYC'd Ethereum Layer 2 Blockchain After Raising $5M:** \n\nKinto, a blockchain startup, raises $5 million to launch the first KYC verified Ethereum layer 2. It will use ZKPs for privacy and security, and lower fees and latency. It will enable dApps to comply with AML and CTF rules, and access the mainstream market. It has partnered with several dApps, and will launch its token, KNT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\ud83d\ude4e\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u00a0Ethereum rollups: \u2018Gold standard\u2019 revisit Plasma, Buterin:**\n\nEthereum co-founder Buterin praises rollups as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for scaling Ethereum, and suggests Plasma, a layer 2 solution that faced challenges, could be improved with rollups. Rollups bundle transactions on a sidechain, and send the final state to the main chain. This reduces congestion and fees, while keeping security and decentralization. Buterin says rollups can boost Ethereum\u2019s throughput by 100 times, and can work with other solutions, like sharding and statelessness, for more scalability. He also says Plasma, which creates child chains that process transactions faster and cheaper, but had problems with exiting and data availability, could be fixed with rollups. He explains that Plasma with rollups would let users exit the child chain without waiting, and would solve the data issue. He adds that Plasma with rollups could be good for applications that need high security and low latency, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u26cf\ufe0f Bitcoin Mining Marathon: Pivot to International Ventures Before Halving:**\n\nMarathon, a bitcoin mining company, plans to grow in Canada and Kazakhstan, and to explore other blockchain areas.

{"selftext":"Hey, this is going to be a long (but happy) post!\n\n2 months ago my brother started working on a tool to automate web3 actions. The purpose is multifold and spans into a complete automation solution (think Zapier).\u00a0\n\nAs always, let\u2019s start with the boring stuff, shall we?\n\nHe just finished the first version of the backend, and started adding specific use-cases. Right now there's simple actions (email, messages to social apps, webhooks) that can be triggered by 4 on-chain events: ETH transfer, ERC20 transfer, ERC721 transfer, and ERC1155 transfer.\n\nThese triggers can be configured and you can setup your own filters to get granular (like receiver, sender, amount or token address). You can see a demo on the homepage at l3mbda.com that filters based on txs from Binance.\n\nMoving on from the humblebrag and boring stuff to something more exciting for us all. What is the reason I\u2019m posting this here? Is it big brain marketing? Well, you\u2019re gonna see from my history that I haven\u2019t posted it anywhere else, nor will that happen in the future. The reason is written below.\n\nMe and him spend a lot of time on reddit and gathered quite the number of moons together, and never sold once. Fast forward to 1 month ago, our overlords at Reddit decided to rug the rewards program and make all MOONS & DONUTS basically worthless.\n\nWe felt like crap when it was announced, not due to the time spent (we're redditors since childhood almost), but because it felt like they abandoned this space altogether. It wasn\u2019t about MOONS\/DONUTS or a subbreddit.\n\nTo be fair, I'm not mad they removed it (it\u2019s a private company, not a public good), but that doesn't excuse the way they chose to handle it and how it made us all feel during those days. That\u2019s what rubbed me the wrong way personally. Combined with the fact that a mod sold theirs before the announcement left a sour taste in my mouth. Glad he\/she is out, mods here are mature and nice compared to other places, good for them that they cleaned the basket from bad apples.\n\nSo, I\u2019m here with a gift to bring a smile to your face and make us forget all about that. Maybe, just maybe, also make some money with this?\n\nHow exactly? This can be used in a lot of ways, like monitoring your wallet for outbound transfers (get alerted instantly if someone starts transfering stuff out of it), following the actions of good on-chain traders (still in the works), monitoring of hacker addresses by governments or sleuths like zachxbt. Also, this doesn\u2019t get triggered by fake transfers\/events like those on Etherscan, it has to be a real transaction that was processed by the network.\n\nHe's very proud of it (as I understand the speed from trigger to event is miles ahead than using any provider like infura or rolling your own solution), and he's eager to share it with you and see what you think. Is there something missing? Do you see something that sucks and expected if to behave otherwise? Right now it's only on Mainnet, would this be useful for you on other chains?\u00a0\n\nIf you go to l3mbda.com and create an account you\u2019re gonna see the Free tier is limited to only 3 active Blocks (alerts) and no Email Blocks. There\u2019s a secret page [https:\/\/l3mbda.com\/reddit](https:\/\/l3mbda.com\/reddit), where if you enter the following code \u201cIWASRUGGED\u201d you\u2019re gonna get the Standard tier (not the Starter\/Basic one) for lifetime. I told him I was thinking of something and he should give me a coupon and create a redeem page, but I hope I don\u2019t bankrupt him lol. This is not a basic no-code app, it has an infrastructure close to an enterprise product in the back. If too many people join it will be disabled I guess, but everyone who got it will keep the benefits for life.\n\nHe\u2019s also on Twitter with the same name as the site, but hasn\u2019t posted anything. If you guys like this send him an encouragement message, but tell him it sucks or its slow first, so I can see his reaction when he gets the notifs.\u00a0\n\n\\*no card, wallet, blood or eyeball scan necessary. you can't even connect a wallet.\\*\n\nLFG \ud83d\ude80","title":"My brother made a tool for degens and is giving it away for free","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700091552,"id":"17w7mlu"}

{"selftext":"Disclaimer: This post is for educational purposes only. Please practice DYOR and do enjoy discussing your thoughts in comments below! \n\n A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization built on rules encoded as a computer program that is frequently transparent, controlled by the organization's members, and uninfluenced by a central government.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/raukekwt2q0c1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=df6398e3037775883fac75a95c3188153beafd78\n\nDAOs, in general, should be member-owned communities with no centralized leadership. The financial transaction records and program rules are kept on a blockchain. This type of business organization's precise legal status is unknown.\n\n# PROS:\n\n**An Autonomous Structure**\n\n* The majority of traditional organizations and groups have a top-down structure that values decisions made at the top and frequently ignores the ideas of those at the bottom. DAOs, due to it's nature, can help solve the problem by allowing everyone to contribute an idea\/option, which can then be voted on by the organization's members.\n\n**Everyone can participate**\n\n* Tokens or NFTs that grant voting rights are used to coordinate governance. Membership in a DAO is restricted to those who have confirmed ownership of these governance tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet, and membership can be exchanged. Governance is carried out through a series of proposals that members vote on via the blockchain, and having more governance tokens often translates to having more voting power. As long as you have the necessary amount of tokens needed to have voting power then you have the right to vote within the organization.\n\n**Proposals are Thorough and Specific**\n\n* The creation of a poll within a DAO is expensive more often than not and with that most members who plan to create one often times try to convey their ideas as specific as possible. No one would try to create non-sensical polls that do not contribute to the growth of the organization if they would know the cost behind it.\n\n**Everything is Transparent and Eternal**\n\n* Everything that occurs within the DAO is permanently recorded on the blockchain. Members of the DAO have access to all decisions made since the organization's inception, with no findings of forgery or misinformation.","title":"The Importance of a DAO in Crypto","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700147000,"id":"17wp01i"}

{"selftext":"A new report from blockchain security platform Immunefi suggests that nearly half of all crypto lost from Web3 exploits is due to Web2 security issues such as leaked private keys. The report, released on Nov. 15, looked back at the history of crypto exploits in 2022, categorizing them into different types of vulnerabilities. It concluded that a full 46.48% of the crypto lost from exploits in 2022 was not from smart contract flaws but rather from \u201cinfrastructure weaknesses\u201d or issues with the developing firm\u2019s computer systems.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/amt28fvtlq0c1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=36f898dada806c913ed7e6efa531057a2cd33ddd\n\n When considering the number of incidents instead of the value of crypto lost, Web2 vulnerabilities were a smaller portion of the total at 26.56%, although they were still the second-largest category.\n\nThe report excluded exit scams or other frauds, as well as exploits that occurred solely because of market manipulations. It only considered attacks that occurred because of a security vulnerability. Of these, it found that attacks fall into three broad categories. First, some attacks occur because the smart contract contains a design flaw. Immunefi cited the BNB Chain bridge hack as an example of this type of vulnerability. Second, some attacks occur because, even though the smart contract is designed well, the code implementing the design is flawed. Immunefi cited the Qbit hack as an example of this category.\n\nFinally, a third category of vulnerability is \u201cinfrastructure weaknesses,\u201d which Immunefi defined as \u201cthe IT infrastructure on which a smart contract operates\u2014for example, virtual machines, private keys, etc.\u201d As an example of this type of vulnerability, Immunefi listed the Ronin bridge hack, which was caused by an attacker gaining control of five out of nine Ronin nodes validator signatures.\n\nImmunefi broke down these categories further into subcategories. When it comes to infrastructure weaknesses, these can be caused by an employee leaking a private key (for example, by transmitting it across an insecure channel), using a weak passphrase for a key vault, problems with tw-factor authentication, DNS hijacking, BGP hijacking, a hot wallet compromise, or using weak encryption methods and storing them in plaintext.","title":"46% of crypto lost from exploits is due to traditional Web2 flaws","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700152570,"id":"17wr958"}

{"selftext":"Based on [feedback received](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17t86pj\/comment\/k8x32p3\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) here.  Normally I wouldn't make a post about this but this release had some significant changes that I wanted everyone to be aware of.  I will update the official FAQ post early next week to add this functionality.\n\n# New features:\n\n1. Ability to send a tip to a specific user\n2. Ability to send multiple tips in the same comment.\n3. Ability to fund your earn2tip account with additional funds\n\n# Details:\n\n**Send a tip to a specific user**\n\nusage: !tip u\/\\[username\\] amount token\n\nexample: !tip u\/aminok 10  \nexample: !tip u\/aminok 10 donut\n\nThis can be done from any comment in the sub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Send multiple tips in the same comment**\n\nexample: \"!tip u\/aminok 10 !tip u\/mattg1981 10 donut\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fund your earn2tip account with additional funds**\n\nUse this functionality when you plan to send out more earn2tip tips than you expect to actually earn for the distribution period.  For example, if you want to send a tip of 10,000 donuts but don't anticipate earning that much in a round, you can fund your account to cover the tip(s).  Any amount funded that is not used during that distribution will be returned to the sender at time of distribution.\n\n*How do I fund my account?*\n\nSend **donut** (currently the only token supported) from your registered wallet address to the multi-sig address (**0x682b5664C2b9a6a93749f2159F95c23fEd654F0A**).  A scheduled process runs every 10 minutes to find all new transfers to this account.  When a transaction is found, it will lookup your username (based on the sender of the transaction) and send a direct message to you within Reddit about the account being funded.  You can also verify that a funded transaction was located by using the command **!tip status** \\- which now shows your funded amounts (if any).  \n\n***Please note that this only looks for simple Transfer events (aka open Metamask and 'send' to the multi-sig).  Do not send funds to the multisig by any other means (e.g. smart contract, send from exchange, etc.), otherwise the amount will not be funded (as the sender of the transaction will most likely not match you wallet address).  Also, ensure that you are registered before funding your account, otherwise we may not be able to match your funds.  Additionally,*** ***be sure to keep a copy of your transaction hash as that will be needed to help troubleshoot any issues that may arise.***\n\n***Please send a test transaction first so that you ensure everything is in working order!!!!***","title":"donut-bot - update 2023-11-17 - change log","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700260421,"id":"17xr46b"}

The value of its in-game cryptocurrency had crashed.\n\nThe engineer went through the job application process before finally being sent a PDF with the salary details.\n\nHe clicked the link, but the job offer was fake.\n\n[North Korean hackers now had access to Sky Mavis's private keys](https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2022-04-16\/north-korea-hackers-crypto-heist\/100995210) \u2014 the access codes for the company's cryptocurrency account.\n\nThey stole around $600 million in cryptocurrency in one of history's biggest heists \u2014 not just of cryptocurrency, but of anything.\n\nAs international sanctions have cut into North Korea's ability to import and export things, it's been running lots of plots and schemes to get access to foreign currency.\n\nBut it's discovered that nothing compares to stealing cryptocurrency. And last year, stealing cryptocurrency was North Korea's primary form of foreign currency income.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/61zx41n1e21c1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=69d6bbfabc06e90ee4e53b5c84471bf4b57f7d17\n\n#  Wannacry: The biggest cyber attack in history\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fw1vtl0je21c1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b48c436ef7da3eb10bf70beb96241a0272b324\n\n \n\nIn 2017, North Korea's hackers made one of their first attempts to raise revenue from cybercrime.\n\nThey developed a virus called Wannacry that wormed its way through a security flaw in Microsoft Windows in the biggest cyber attack in history.\n\nThe list of victims was extremely broad. The attack hit Britain's hospital network, Germany's rail system and scores of companies and government agencies.\n\nThe attack wasn't as effective as it could have been, though.\n\nBritish cybersecurity researcher Marcus Hutchins found that the hackers had inserted a \"kill switch\" into the code in case they wanted to stop the virus from spreading any further.\n\nSo he just, kind of, flicked that switch.\n\nPlus, news got around that even if you paid the ransom, there was no guarantee that your files would be unlocked.\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands of computers were infected, fewer than 500 ransom payments were made.\n\nThe North Korean hackers received about 51 Bitcoin, which, thanks to the outrageous volatility of Bitcoin, could have been worth anywhere between US$100,000 and US$3.5 million, depending on when the hackers sold it.\n\nEither way, it's not a huge amount.\n\nTo make real money, North Korea has turned its attention to robbing crypto exchanges and taking millions of dollars at a time.\n\n# North Korea hits the big time\n\nMost people trade their crypto using cryptocurrency exchanges that basically do the same things a bank does.\n\nBut as opposed to banks, crypto exchanges are unregulated and often have poor security measures.\n\nWhile robbing a bank is risky, robbing a crypto exchange, it appears, is just a matter of sending an attractive job offer to a senior employee.\n\nNorth Korea's hackers have been robbing crypto exchange after crypto exchange.\n\nIn 2022, North Korea's hacking gang was responsible for half of all cryptocurrency theft. Their haul was $US1.65 billion.\n\nThat's more than three times the amount made globally from ransomware last year.\n\nIt's nearly twice as much as they made from all other exports.\n\nYes \u2014 to be clear \u2014 last year, stealing cryptocurrency was North Korea's primary form of foreign currency income.\n\nKim Jong-un celebrated this windfall by doing as many missile launch tests in a single year as he had in the previous decade.\n\nNorth Korea tested 121 rockets in 15 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z2k7skyqe21c1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5b9f321b7487249baaf8eb9f49d2cad3888b479\n\nNow there's speculation Kim is selling some of his weapons to Russia to assist Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Another exciting revenue stream.\n\nAt the moment, there's no real plan to stop him. Crypto exchanges are still unregulated, insecure pots of money that he \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 can raid to pay for nuclear weapons.","title":"North Korea was floundering under sanctions.

{"selftext":"Scroll has raised $80+M in Fundings from Polychain Capital, Sequoia Capital, Gate Ventures, Variant Fund, Newman Capital and more, and is one of the hottest L2s to farm this year.\n\nI'll try to make this guide as easy and comprehensive as possible, so all BroNuts who wishes to particpate in the farming will eventually meet the qualifying criteria!\n\n**Step-by-Step Beginner Guide with links:**\n\n**Step 1: Bridge to Scroll**: Go to the **official Scroll bridge**, [https:\/\/scroll.io\/bridge](https:\/\/scroll.io\/bridge) , and **bridge to Scroll blockchain** at least **ONCE**.\n\nI recommend bridging in and out (don't bridge out everything maybe, leave some in for gas fees) uusing the **main bridge which has high fees once, but use Orbiter subsequently (see my additional pro tip below)**\n\n**Step 2**: **Making swaps on Scroll**: Connect to Scroll blockchain, and swap your **Eth -> USDC** on [https:\/\/sushi.com\/swap](https:\/\/sushi.com\/swap), and USDC back to Eth.\n\n**Avoid making swaps from Eth -> Weth** which has cheaper gas fees as these may not be taken into consideration for the qualifying criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Deploy contract on Scroll:** This step will make you eligible for a Scroll 'Alpha' NFT by the official scroll team. Go to [https:\/\/minter.merkly.com\/deploy\/empty](https:\/\/minter.merkly.com\/deploy\/empty), select network as Scroll and click deploy.\n\n**Step 4: Add liquidity**: Personally, I have added a small amount of liquidity to the **USDC - Eth LP on Sushi** (I'm sure there are other DEXes but I've gone with this). Go to [https:\/\/www.sushi.com\/pool](https:\/\/www.sushi.com\/pool) , select 'Scroll' under network and click the Eth- USDC pool.\n\nYou probably only need add a small amount of liquidity for the qualifying criteria (maybe $30 - $100 in total, $20 in USDC and $20 in Eth maybe), but feel free to add more if you'd like.\n\n**Step 5: Do transactions across multiple weeks**: Try to **transactions on Scroll blockchain least once a week** (i.e Step 1 bridging out of Scroll, or step 2 swaps)m so the **Scroll blockchain records you as doing transactions across multiple different weeks - this is important evidence for all farming.** You don't need to make tonnes of transactions each week, just 1 or 2 transactions for future weeks would suffice if you already made a lot of transaction volume at the start.\n\nIf you've followed the links and done all 4 steps, congratulations\n\n**Pro-tips (for professional farmers** once you've figured out the earlier steps!):\n\n1) **Pro tip for step 1 bridging:** After you use the main bridge (I used once for deposits and once for withdrawals), I recommend using [https:\/\/www.orbiter.finance\/](https:\/\/www.orbiter.finance\/) for all futute bridging and bridge into Scroll using L2 instead of the Eth mainnet for much lower fees. \n\nFor future and subsequent weeks, you can **use Orbiter to bridge in and out of Scroll to other L2s** that has not launched like **ZkSync\/LINEA\/BASE\/PolygonZKEVM** \\- how's that for **lower fees+ double farming !**\n\n2) **Pro tip for step 2 swaps:** Gas fees are the same regardless of the amount you swap, and transaction volume is a criteria so it's preferable you swap a substanial amount (Above $100 or 0.1 eth) for the first few swaps at least.\n\n**3) Pro tip for step 5:** Some people ask how many transactions, the key is to **stay consistent across multiple weeks rather than 'rushing' everything at once.** But minimally you should aim for 25 transaction records, which will be easily done if you do maybe 10 swaps in the first week (figuring out bridging\/LP etc) and then do an average of 2-3 swaps per week for the next 2 months. \n\nOf course, feel free to do more swaps (up to 50, or up to 100) if you'd like. Follow the scroll twitter [https:\/\/twitter.com\/Scroll\\_ZKP](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Scroll_ZKP?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for live-time updates!\n\nThat's it folks, and special thanks to u\/OldDomainer and u\/DbriMatt which has shared some farming tips with me as well.

{"selftext":"Hey All, \n\nQuick guide on crypto taxes for those of us in the US if anyone was interested! Quick run down for those doing it first time, and a strategy to use if you need to recognise any losses.\n\nAs the IRS has made a big deal out of taxpayers reporting their cryptocurrency transactions recently. Starting in 2021, the IRS even put a question front and center on the front page of the 1040 individual tax return form asking taxpayers to confirm whether they have received, sold, exchanged, or disposed of virtual currency.\n\nHere are the basics on how to report cryptocurrency income when filing your taxes:\n\n**Mining income** is taxed as ordinary income based on the fair market value of your coins on the day you received them. Alternatively, many taxpayers treat their mining activity as a business. There are benefits and downsides to this.\n\nThe benefits are that you can deduct expenses that were used to generate mining income. This includes utilities, software, and the actual mining hardware. The downside is that business income is subject to employment taxes (social security and medicare).\n\n**Staking Income** are taxed as ordinary income as well, based on the fair market value of the coins on the day you received them.\n\n**Trades and Swaps** are taxed as capital gains and capital losses. Capital Gains and Losses are broken in to two different groups: Short-Term (Held the asset one year or less), Long Term (Held the asset for more than one year).\n\nShort-Term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. This depends on your income and filing status.\n\nLong-Term capital gains are taxed at preferential tax rates, based on the taxable income of the taxpayer.\n\nWhen you have gains and losses, you net the short term capital gains and losses with each other, and the long term capital gains with each other, and then net those two totals.\n\nIt is important to note that only $3,000 in capital losses ($1,500 if married filing separately) can be taken against ordinary income per year.\n\nSo do you have to report your crypto on your tax return if you don\u2019t sell?\n\nFor crypto that you mined, staked, or were air-dropped? Yes, you need to report this on your tax return.\n\nFor crypto that you purchased? No - you only report this activity when you sell, exchange, or dispose of the coins.\n\nNow here\u2019s the loophole (and I\u2019m hesitant to use the term \u201cloophole\u201d in most situations, but this is a legitimate loophole that will likely be closed in future tax years):\n\nWhen trading stocks, there is a rule called the wash sale rule. This rule essentially prevents taxpayers from selling a stock that they had a loss on and then buying it right back (within 30 days) in order to claim a loss for tax purposes.\n\nHowever, for now, cryptocurrency is not subject to the wash sale rule.\n\nThat means, for all the crypto that you have been holding which has gone down, you can sell it and buy it right back (on the same day if you wanted to), in order to recognize a tax loss.\n\nIf you have gains from selling other assets, these losses will offset those gains.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have gains to offset, you can take up to $3,000 of these losses this year, and then $3,000 every year after that (or until you have other gains to offset).\n\nEither way, it\u2019s a win-win.\n\nKeep in mind that when you sell and repurchase the asset, this resets the holding period. That means, if the coin goes up in value, and you want to sell, you\u2019ll need to wait a year in order to get the preferential tax rates (long term capital gains). You can still sell before then, but it will be taxed at your ordinary tax rates.","title":"Cryptocurrency Tax Basics Guide and a 'loophole' (wash sale rule) for those in the US","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700472424,"id":"17zkp3s"}

But investors have since moved 152,583 ETH off exchanges, bringing the total market supply to a 5-year low of 14.3.  \n\n\nSpecifically, July 2018, was the last time the ETH market supply was this low. Crypto whales and sophisticated high-networth investors are known to opt for cold wallet storage. If the Blackrock ETF filing attracts more whales to buy ETH, the exchange supply will likely drop even further. \n\nNotably, ETH price had also dropped to 2018 lows when it skyrocketed to an all-time high of $4,891 back in 2021.  \n\nHence, the rapid decline in Ethereum market supply could put upward pressure on ETH price toward the $4,000 market if the Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) Spot ETF applications are approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).","title":"Ethereum Exchange Supply Hits 5-Year Low: Will It Propel ETH to $4,000?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700508951,"id":"17zwu1z"}

Additionally, IntoTheBlock data indicates that 45% of Ethereum (ETH) holders are large wallet owners, with the current breakdown showing 48% of ETH holders at a loss, 49% in profit, and 3% breaking even.\n\nA glance at the Ethereum block explorer,\u00a0EtherScan, shows the top holders of ETH are exchanges rather than individual entities. According to EtherScan, the top ten holders of ETH are associated with various cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Kraken, and Gemini.\n\n**The Top Five:**\u00a0Beacon Deposit Contract is noted as the top holder with 27.5% holdings of the total ETH circulating supply. The holding stands at 33 million coins worth $66.8 billion, based on EtherScan [data](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/accounts) updated Nov. 20, 2023. \u00a0\n\nTechoPedia states that the reason why Beacon Deposit Contract is the largest ETH holder is that it enables users to transfer their funds from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mainnet to the Beacon Chain, linked to Ethereum 2.0\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nFollowing the list is Wrapped Ether holding 2.6% of the total circulating supply with 3.1 million coins (worth $6.3 billion). Next is a wallet address linked to Binance 7 with 1.6% (worth $4 billion) of the supply. Kraken 13 (1.3%) and Robinhood (1.2%) follow the list of top ETH holders with holdings worth $3.2 billion and $3 billion respectively.\n\nAs Ethereum is deeply linked to the NFT ecosystem, many celebrities are also part of the large ETH holders. DappRadar data published by Techopedia in mid-October indicates that **Snoop Dogg**, **Zach Hyman**, **Mark Cuban**, and\u00a0**Gary Vaynerchuk**\u00a0are among the top celebrities holding ETH.\n\n**Top Ethereum Wallet:** A crypto wallet is a tool, either a physical device or a software program, designed for the secure storage and management of cryptocurrencies. [According](http:\/\/www.techopedia.com\/cryptocurrency\/best-ethereum-wallets#:~:text=MetaMask%20%E2%80%93%20Non%2DCustodial%20Wallet%20for,supported%20by%20multiple%20device%20types) to TechoPedia, MetaMask is considered the top non-custodial wallet for holding Ethereum in 2023. It boasts over 30 million users\u00a0worldwide and offers compatibility across various device types.\n\nAdditionally, MetaMask is recognized for its quick performance, attributed to its user-friendly interface, making it a highly recommended choice for Ethereum storage.\n\nLedger is another popular wallet\u00a0for storing Ether. Contrasting with the free MetaMask wallet, Ledger comes at a price but offers added security through a chip designed to safeguard ETH assets from cyber theft.  \n\n\n# Where are we going Guys, I need to set Targets to Buy.\n\nSource [here](https:\/\/www.benzinga.com\/markets\/cryptocurrency\/23\/11\/35866592\/bitcoin-surges-after-javier-milei-elected-president-of-argentina-ethereum-dogecoin-seen-in)","title":"Ethereum Price Surge Results In Wallets Exceeding $1B: A Look At Top 5 ETH Holders","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700510325,"id":"17zxddx"}

It operates on a DAO model, which empowers community members to direct the platform\u2019s course via the CAGA token. This community-driven ethos is the heartbeat of CAGA Crypto, enabling a 100% community-led decision-making process. This way, the platform can morph in line with its users\u2019 desires. The unique CAGA token facilitates active user participation in governance while earning rewards through a liquid staking system.  \n\n\nTransparency is a hallmark of CAGA Crypto, especially in how they handle their treasury. They aim to foster trust and engagement within the community, laying a solid foundation for future growth. The platform also embraces anonymous voting, ensuring every member has an equal say in shaping its destiny.  \n\n\nCAGA has recently enhanced its staking platform, attracting those interested in rewards through the official initiation of its project, which includes real-time staking and governance capabilities. Notably, this innovative advancement surpasses traditional incentives by offering consumers a distinctive dual framework integrating engagement-based bonuses with investment yields. Additionally, it presents compelling prospects for community involvement and decision-making, cultivating a perception of proactive engagement among users.  \n\n\nAs part of its strategic initiative to enhance flexibility, CAGA has also introduced liquid staking tokens.

Integrating involvement, flexibility, and community empowerment in this comprehensive strategy establishes a novel benchmark within the staking domain.  \n\n\nI read as well that CAGA has successfully obtained a significant inclusion on CoinGecko, signifying another crucial milestone for the project. Both achievements of being tradeable on UniSwapV2 and listed on CoinGecko demonstrate CAGA\u2019s dedication to promoting broad accessibility, liquidity, and legitimacy, solidifying its status as a potential asset within the ever-evolving cryptocurrency domain.  \n\n\nSo, what do you think?

These measures include hardware-enforced App Store exclusivity and restrictions on web browser technology, which, according to the plaintiffs, allow Apple to dictate the terms for new iOS P2P payment apps, often excluding crypto options as a condition for their entry into the market.\n\nThe plaintiffs identify themselves as consumers who have incurred higher fees as a result of Apple\u2019s trade restrictions in the iOS peer-to-peer payment sector.\n\nThey seek to obtain compensation for the excessive charges they attribute to Apple\u2019s purported anti-competitive behaviour, and they are also seeking a court order to prevent the company from engaging in and enforcing agreements that limit competition in the iOS P2P payment market, affecting both existing competitors and potential new entrants.\n\nThe filing, comprising 58 pages, chronicles the development and ascent of peer-to-peer payment applications, the emergence of decentralized cryptocurrencies, and Apple\u2019s introduction into this sector.\n\nSignificantly, in April, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that Apple breached California\u2019s competition laws by preventing apps from guiding users toward payment solutions outside of Apple\u2019s system. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k3rls4s6uq1c1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=daa9bfe2f14a156ad296314614e5455bbef09ee1\n\n## Crypto apps tussle to stay in Apple store\n\nApple\u2019s policies mandate that app developers contribute 30% of their transaction earnings.\n\nThis requirement has [posed a challenge](https:\/\/crypto.news\/us-lawmakers-raise-concerns-over-apples-crypto-and-nft-policies\/) for cryptocurrency companies, especially those involved in offering non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in their efforts to serve iOS users.\n\nApple has also [reportedly removed Damus](https:\/\/crypto.news\/damus-crypto-tipping-app-reports-guideline-abuse-after-clarifying-no-content-is-sold\/), a social media application that supports Bitcoin, from the App Store for failing to comply with its terms of service.\n\nThe app features a tipping option, which permits content creators to get tips in Bitcoin through the Lightning Network.\n\nApple considered this tipping feature to be in breach of its policies since it forbids developers from offering additional in-app content unless such transactions are conducted via Apple, from which the company extracts a 30% fee.\n\nEarlier in October, the popular Ethereum wallet [MetaMask also experienced a brief removal](https:\/\/crypto.news\/metamask-wallet-removed-from-apple-app-store\/) from the Apple App Store, only to be reinstated later.  \n\n\n# What's wrong with Apple?\n\nSource [here.](https:\/\/crypto.news\/apple-hit-with-lawsuit-for-blocking-crypto-in-p2p-payments\/)","title":"Apple hit with lawsuit for blocking crypto in P2P payments","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1700591042,"id":"180nn3g"}

{"selftext":"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reaffirmed his company's commitment to compliance and regulation in the crypto industry, following the news of Binance's $4 billion settlement and Changpeng Zhao's stepping down as CEO of Binance.\n\nIn a post on X, Armstrong said that Coinbase, which is one of the largest and most popular crypto exchanges in the world, has taken a long-term view since its founding in 2012. \n\nHe said that he knew the company needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time. \n\nHe said that Coinbase got the licenses, hired the compliance and legal teams, and made it clear that its brand was about trust with its customers and following the rules. \n\nHe also said that Coinbase wanted to increase transparency and raise the bar on trust, so it became a public company in 2021.\n\nArmstrong acknowledged that taking a compliant approach meant that Coinbase couldn't always move as quickly as others, and that it was more difficult and expensive to do so. He said that Coinbase couldn't launch every product that customers wanted when it was illegal, but that it was the right approach because the company believed in rule of law.\n\n>Doing it the hard way was the right decision, and that Coinbase now had an opportunity to start a new chapter for the industry. \n\nHe said that Coinbase took a lot of arrows operating in the US due to the lack of regulatory clarity, and that he hoped that the news would serve as a catalyst to finally achieve that. \n\nHe said that Americans should not have to go to offshore unregulated exchanges to benefit from this technology, and that the industry should be built right here in America, in a compliant way, under US law. He said that Coinbase was going to stay in the US because it believed in economic freedom and that the US democratic system would eventually get this right.\n\nHe ended the post by saying that decentralization and crypto was a powerful tool to update the financial system and build a global economy with more economic freedom, and.. \n\n>!We're just getting started \ud83d\ude80!<\n\nMany praised Coinbase for its leadership and vision in the crypto space, while others expressed their excitement and optimism about the future of crypto in the US and globally.\n\nHowever, Coinbase has also faced some challenges and controversies in its journey, especially in relation to regulation and compliance. It has been subject to investigations and lawsuits from various regulators and authorities, such as the SEC, the CFTC, the IRS, and the Department of Justice (DOJ), over issues such as market manipulation, insider trading, tax evasion, and data privacy. \n\nIt has also been criticized by some crypto advocates and enthusiasts for being too centralized, too conservative, or too compliant, and for not supporting certain crypto assets or features, such as XRP, privacy coins, or decentralized exchanges.\n\nCoinbase is just getting started, and the crypto industry is entering a new chapter..\n\nSource: https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1727054176763756826?t=dNGCgt_oxGDsAvSn2nYT7w&s=19","title":"Following Binance's Hefty Fine and CEO CZ's Resign News, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Said \"We're Just Getting Started \ud83d\ude80\"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700600851,"id":"180ri6e"}

{"selftext":"According to Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, the average gas fees on Ethereum hit multi-month highs last week. The platform expressly notes that the primary driver has been Uniswap\u2019s activities, reading from the rising transaction volumes from meme coins, including GROK. This, in turn, pushed block space demand higher, increasing gas fees.\n\nGas fees remain volatile but generally higher in the first three weeks of November. As of November 20, Ycharts data shows that the average cost of sending a transaction stood at 45.13 Gwei, nearly 100% from November 19, when it was at 24.84 Gwei. This is a significant jump from 17.66 Gwei in late October 2023.\n\nGas fees and how ETH and DeFi token prices react are directly correlated as DeFi and other on-chain activities like non-fungible token (NFT) minting and trading rise; gas fees usually expand in trending markets.\n\n\nEthereum remains a choice platform for deploying DeFi apps despite the relatively gas fees pinned to mainnet scaling challenges. The pioneer smart contract blockchain manages $25.4 billion in TVL, whereas Uniswap is one of the largest protocols with $3.216 billion in TVL.\n\nSource - https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/defi\/defi-ethereum-gas-fees-rising-uniswap-stuck\/","title":"Ethereum Gas Fees Rising:DeFi gathering momentum!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700634230,"id":"1812nrz"}

{"selftext":"\nEthereum Whales Buy $124 Billion Worth Of Tokens\n\nSantiment reports that the top 200 Ethereum whales have been buying ETH since November 21, 2022. This was just a few weeks after the FTX crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy, sending cryptocurrency prices across the space into a downward spiral. ETH prices would eventually fall as low as $900 and as fear grew, so did the opportunity for buying.\n\nHowever, even after prices began to recover once more, breaking above $1,000, these large investors did not reduce their buying. Santiment reveals that they continued to purchase tokens and by November 2022, these top 200 Ethereum wallets have bought up $124 billion worth of ETH.\n\nIn total, these addresses increased their holdings by a whopping 30%, and they now hold a collective 62.76 million tokens. This figure means that the top 200 Ethereum wallets now command approximately 52% of the total ETH supply.\n\nThe whale buying spree has not been the only bullish development for Ethereum though as there has been a marked increase in the number of new ETH wallets that are being created. Santiment notes that on Tuesday, November 21, a total of 94,700 new wallets were created on the network, a new 4-month high. This could point to a return of interest in the ecosystem and adoption could trigger a price recovery.\n\nAlthough the price of Ethereum has been hit hard following the news of Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao hitting the space hard, it has maintained a reasonable price level just below $2,000. This ensures that forecasts are still valid and the chances of recovery remain high.\n\nSource\nhttps:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum\/ethereum-richest-eth-124-billion\/","title":"Richest ETH Wallets Go On Massive $124 Billion Buying Spree: ETH is still Bullish","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700651326,"id":"1816pn1"}

{"selftext":"# Technical Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent forceful upswing encountered resistance upon reaching a critical price region, encompassing the $2K threshold and the upper boundary of an ascending wedge.\n\nThis resulted in a phase of consolidation correction, retracing towards the 100 and 200-day Moving Averages (MAs).\n\n# The Daily Chart\n\nA comprehensive analysis of the daily chart exposes a notable presence of supply in the crucial $2K region, coinciding with the upper boundary of the multi-month wedge.\n\nThe selling pressure in this pivotal resistance zone disrupted the significant upward momentum, ushering in a phase of consolidation correction within the market.\n\nConsidering the significance of the $2K resistance and the upper boundary of the associated wedge pattern, there is a high likelihood of a temporary extension of the ongoing retracement, followed by consolidation around the breached moving averages.\n\nIf the price completes a pullback to these moving averages, it could prompt buyers to re-enter the market with the objective of once again challenging the substantial $2K level.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yucmbeqc0y1c1.jpg?width=1835&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d14f9081a87ac1872ab9a084e00e24629d9ab1c\n\n# The 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, it is evident that Ethereum\u2019s robust uptrend lost steam upon encountering the critical resistance at $2K. This region represents a pivotal psychological barrier, creating obstacles for buyers aiming to propel the price higher due to a notable supply presence, indicating heightened selling pressure in this key area.\n\nFollowing a rejection near the $2K resistance zone, the price entered a consolidation correction phase, forming a bullish flag pattern. This well-known technical pattern implies a potential continuation of the initial uptrend, contingent on a successful breach of its upper boundary.\n\nGiven the current market dynamics, there is a considerable likelihood of an extended consolidation correction phase in the short term, targeting the support range between the 0.5 and 61.8 levels of the Fibonacci retracement ($1,839 \u2013 $1,769).\n\nHowever, in the event of a sudden breakout above the flag\u2019s upper boundary, the market could experience a substantial surge, with the objective of reclaiming the decisive $2K resistance zone.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4o6vpcfe0y1c1.jpg?width=1835&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b9d5517b6f805ec66b981acc797402666d7638c\n\n# On-chain Analysis\n\nIn the wake of Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge, market participants have embraced an optimistic outlook for the medium-term future. This positive sentiment has triggered substantial buying activity across both the spot and futures markets.\n\nThe accompanying chart illustrates the funding rates, a crucial metric for gauging sentiment in the futures market. Positive values indicate a bullish sentiment, while negative values are associated with a bearish sentiment. Notably, the funding rates have consistently exhibited elevated values in recent weeks. However, a noticeable decline has emerged concurrently with a retracement in Ethereum\u2019s price. This shift suggests a temporary pause in the futures market, poised for a potential fresh and impulsive move.\n\nDespite this, investors should be careful, considering the recent price downturn may signify the onset of a more extensive bearish phase, potentially leading to the liquidation of a significant number of long positions.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tojqzttg0y1c1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa1412c73b3f9a57730bd6e8292a34dbbb5d3f5e\n\n# What do you think?

More L2 blockchains launched. We see EVM Roll ups, side chains, or Validium\u2019s that use zk-proofs. Vitalik Buterin has for a long time been supporting L2 blockchains. He wrote a blog about some of the issues that L2 blockchains and their bridges face.\n\n \n\n# L2 Blockchains Are Becoming More Diverse\n\nButerin sees more L2 blockchains joining the L2 ecosystem. The main features that L2 blockchains provide are fast and cheap transactions. Ethereum\u2019s users are happy to see gas fees around $0.10 instead of $2 on a good day. However, how can you explain to a Web2 user who never paid any transaction fees, that he needs to pay $0.10? Centralized apps and small L1 chains may experience similar issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/agch4b6s702c1.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa74cdce67cd2c68010ad10f27e4202e6f86c20d\n\n**This is where Buterin sees a challenge in** [**his blog**](https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2023\/10\/31\/l2types.html)**. So, he distinguishes between three different types of L2 blockchains. But everyone, building a** [**Layer 2**](https:\/\/www.altcoinbuzz.io\/?s=layer+2) **chain,** needs to find a balance between the trade-offs. These trade-offs are for centralized apps to become more decentralized. This would make them more secure. However, with a high throughput, rollups couldn\u2019t handle this. \n\n[Source](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/scaling\/summary) of first image \n\n[Source](https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1719241011476463798%7Ctwgr%5Eff483b2178e4891c1139f40c8d5860b4bbd4c7fe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.altcoinbuzz.io%2Fbitcoin-and-crypto-guide%2Fvitalik-buterins-latest-guide-to-l2-blockchains%2F) of viltalik tweet\n\n[Source of the info provided above](https:\/\/www.altcoinbuzz.io\/bitcoin-and-crypto-guide\/vitalik-buterins-latest-guide-to-l2-blockchains\/)","title":"Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Latest Guide to L2 Blockchains","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700704879,"id":"181q5xw"}

{"selftext":"\nWhat are the differences and how will @0xPolygon benefit it ?\n\nPolygon has truly revolutionized Layer-2 scaling with it's CDK. Anyone can come and spin up a Zk-powered L2 using open sourced code like $IMX, $IDEX and more.\n\nThis will give rise to an ecosystem of interconnected chains all powered by the newly launched $POL token\n\nBut how will all these chains be secured along with each other to create a unified L2 ecosystem?\n\nEnter - The Staking Layer for $POL\n\nThe Staking Layer is a programmable multi-chain coordinator of the CDK enabled ecosystem. It maintains 2 things - A validator registry and A chain registry\n\nThe Validator registry maintains a ledger of all validators and their corresponding stakes\n\nThe Chain registry maintains a ledger of all the different L2 chains and their unique configurations\n\nSo now, people can spin up a customized L2 with a few lines of code. This L2 can use $POL or a native token for gas and transaction fees.\n\nSome, or all of these fees can be redirected to validators.\n\nThe difference in utility of $MATIC and $POL is insane if you think about it.\n\n$MATIC is the native token of a simple PoS Ethereum sidechain with lots of issues (like reorgs, etc). Value accrual is limited especially when other L2s with better tech like Optimism and Arbitrum don't even require their native token to be used to transact on the chain\n\n$POL on the other hand is the token that will validate an entire ecosystem of interconnected L2s (held together by the staking layer). It has 3 forms of value accrual:\n\n- Protocol Rewards (Base fees in the form of $POL emissions)\n- Transaction Fees\n- Additional Rewards (Can be paid out to attract more validators.

{"selftext":"# Objective:\n\nTo address community concerns related to the current fixed pay2post fee on r\/ethtrader, this proposal aims to mitigate the current imperfections to the current system by implementing a dynamic fee formula based on post ratio and score. \n\nThis proposal mainly aims to incentivize users to post quality content and to reduce spam.\n\n# The problem with the current situation: round 129 as an example\n\nWith u\/reddito321's data ([post here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17ma4zu\/mydonuts_final_csv_for_round_129_is_ready\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), and the analysis u\/TheNano100 provided to me on Discord, we can get this data for the score of posts during round 129:\n\n*data adjusted with* ***-1 upvote for the default reddit upvote by the poster***\n\n|count|1073|\n|:-|:-|\n|mean|9.6|\n|std|10.6|\n|min|0|\n|25%|2|\n|50%|6|\n|75%|13|\n|max|105|\n\nIf we consider the fact that the post ratio was around 30 for round 129, this means that a post would need to have a raw score of approximately 10 or above to break even: 9x30=270 *(taking into account the -1 upvote for the final calculation).*\n\nThis poses an issue for posters on this subreddit wanting to contribute to this community because more than 50% of all posts result in a loss of DONUT according to this data. To fix this, this proposal addresses this issue by making the pay2post fee dynamic with the formula described in the following section.\n\n# The Formula:\n\n***Fee=Post\u00a0Ratio\u00d7(X)***\n\nX would vary for each round and be calculated as follows:\n\n**X=** minimum score for the top 50% of posts, easily calculated with the csv provided for each round. Taking 129 as an example, the value of X would have been 6 (see table above in previous section).\n\nIn other words, **X would simply be the adjusted score needed to break even.**\n\n* **Example for round 129:** If the post ratio is 30 and the score needed to break even (X) is 6, the fee would be 30\u00d76=180 Donuts. A post would require an adjusted score of 6 to break even in this case.\n\n# Other factors to consider:\n\nWhile implementing a rule that theoretically makes 50% of posts gain donuts, and the other 50% lose donuts seem limiting, we can see that this proposal would actually make it easier for posts to earn donuts, considering most posts were at a loss during round 129. \n\nIt is also important to remember that the total amount of donuts gained for posts is as follows:\n\n1. 510K Donuts per distribution for posts based on score\n2. 340K Donuts per distribution for receiving tips on posts\n\nThis would mean that more than 50% of posts would be at a net positive, since there is also a large portion of donuts allocated for the tipping bonus. In other words, having a post in the bottom 50% could also result in a net positive if the post receives enough tips.\n\n# Reducing Spam:\n\nHowever, making the pay2post fee dynamic poses another issue: if it is easier to post on this subreddit to earn donuts, some users could take advantage of the system and spam the post section with low effort posts. This is why this proposal would also implement a **limit of 3 posts per day for each user**. Doing so would encourage users to provide quality over quantity, and would consequently prevent some users from flooding the post section with low effort link posts.\n\n# Voting options:\n\n**\\[YES\\] Implement Dynamic Pay2Post Fee Formula with 3 Post Limit:**\n\n1. Introduce the dynamic fee formula based on post ratio.\n2. Implement a daily limit of 3 posts per user to prevent spamming.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n* Less risk to lose donuts for posting content\n* Spam prevention\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n* Unpredictable pay2post fee: the X value is available only after the snapshot\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\[NO\\] Maintain Current Pay2Post Fee Structure:**\n\n1. Posts will continue to subject a 250 Donut Fee\n2. No daily limit for posts.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n* Simplicity and ease of understanding for all users.\n* Predictable fee.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n* A high amount of posts may result in a net loss of donuts due to the current pay2post fee.","title":"[Governance Poll Proposal] Dynamic Pay2Post Fee","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700727707,"id":"181wir6"}

{"selftext":"# Objective:    \n\nAllow governance to try an alternative, user optional, way to collect up\/down votes that can:\n\n* lead to better vote tracking and user\/data analysis\n* more transparent inputs to post\/comment content creation value documentation and\n* better user karma calculation leading to \n* more transparent, more aligned, financial and governance rewards.\n\n# The Problem:   \n\nUsing the current reddit 'net up-down vote' tally's as valuation input into any karma model tied to financial rewards leads to the problem that 'net up votes' is a poor and opaque valuation method for posts or comments.  It has long been acknowledged this is a flawed model when coupled with financial\/governance rewards is leading to 'bad behaviors'.  \n\n***Everyone keeps saying we don't have anything else.***  \n\nWell with this proposal (that has users option\/in, option\/out as a key feature) is a potential solution that costs us very little to try.\n\nUsing the reddit data as input for financial\/governance rewards is leading to a number of problems\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* concentration of power both in governance and financially to a small set of users who are likely group aligned in various ways that may not be aligned with the rest of the communities good leading to inability for governance to make concrete change.\n* (rewards disproportionally active groups, bots, sybils) that can effectively \n* lead to forms of financial (DONUT) and in particular governance (CONTRIB) censorship of newcomers.   \n\n# The Proposal:   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* IS A 3 month TRIAL.  \n* Will allow users to OPTIONALLY include the following tags !upvote !downvote tags into their comments as a method to upvote\/downvote a comment or a post.\n* Induce one or more bot players (matt or reddito) to document comment !upvote, !downvote information.\n\nNOTE: (the exact details of all 3 of the above to be determined by another governance proposal should this one pass)\n\n# The Reasoning here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. This is a 3 month data searching trial where people can self select in or out. (you feel like this intrudes on your privacy - DON'UT USE IT!)\n2.  No financial incentives are added to this model so we can see who will do this for free (now).  This leads to a civic participation model that at least during the TRIAL PERIOD is not contaminated by Financial incentives.   Interestingly just the speculation this might lead to retroactive financial\/governance rewards may itself contaminate participation and lead to Speculative incentive participation.  I don't see this as a huge problem for a trail.\n3. We already record comments, net updown vote, why not do a TRAIL a completely new method for people to provide feedback that is OPTIONAL.\n4. Ultimately when you think about it, the idea that the sub could offer an OPTIONAL, ALTERNATIVE feed back model than what exists currently is likely going to be more positive for the sub than negative. \n\n# The Positives:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. This is a SELF SELECTED, OPTIONAL 3 month TRIAL.  Anyone can opt out simply by not using the optional comment tags and opt in by using them.\n2. Has potential to provide 2 distinct datasets (up) and (down) vote data.\n3. Gives governance another, alternate potentially more accurate, user feedback mechanism\/tool to base rewards on\n4. Allows for full analysis on the public vote data to potentially\n   1. identify group behaviors and \n   2. finally isolate and compare our own voluntary public vote records to private reddit voting data.  Loosely speaking if users choose to post their up\/down votes with their vote comments and tags maybe we finally get ability to compare reddit karma to our own tally of karma via up\/down votes.   If everyone commented when they up\/down voted then we finally can figure out how much of the reddit karma is just coming from bots swirling through, vs. actual people (committed to documenting their up\/down voting as a matter of public record via comments) teach other who knows what is possible\n5. Governance Weighted voting on comments becomes possible.\n6. IF this TRIAL is successful it could lead to reddit adopting a new way of reporting voting and karma calculating that is better for all of reddit.\n\n# The Negatives:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Comments with just !upvote or !downvote will clutter like spam.  Given that we have a number of other bot commands being used (like tip, etc. which have a rewards component tied to them and are becoming spam lke.) I don't think this will dramatically increase spam and there are alternative ways we can deal with 'bot command' spam.\n2. Vote purchasing might become a problem.  no way to stop rewarding people via tips (either privately) or publicly.  Since this is a TRIAL with no direct rewards, imo rather unlikely we see vote tipping problems, but if we don't clamp down on it in the TRAIL we can document how much vote tipping occurs.\n3. May lead to unknown or unforseen issues that reflect negatively on the sub and on reddit generally leading to other unknown or unforseen negative results\n\n# Voting Options:\n\n**\\[YES\\] Implement OPTIONAL TRIAL !upvote !downvote comment post tag vote tracking for 3 months**\n\n**\\[NO\\] Don't implement OPTIONAL TRAIL !upvote !downvote post tag vote tracking.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","title":"[Governance Poll Proposal] PUBKARMA TRIAL - Implement public karma !upvote, !downvote comment tag tracking as a 3 month OPTIONAL TRIAL.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700757973,"id":"1825c3n"}

{"selftext":"In a YouTube [video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dNRec3D9UFQ&t=910s&ab_channel=Deribit), Deribit\u2019s Pierino Ursone discussed the possible impact and how the markets might react to the SEC\u2019s approval. \n\n**Why Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF Approval Hold Significance?**\n\nSpeculations of a Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF approval generated considerable anticipation in the market. The cryptocurrency market had a relatively flat price action throughout 2023 until late August. When rumors of a spot BTC ETF hit the wires, the cryptocurrency showed signs of some volatility.\n\n[ Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approval might send the crypto\u2019s prices soaring.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1ee7bw1ia52c1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=001162fdb15a132eb04221b44270cacf31d381ff)\n\nThe rumors attracted market participants because ETFs provide investors with an accessible and regulated option to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying assets.\n\nAdditionally, ETFs might also attract institutional investors who have maintained a cautious distance from the sector due to regulatory and security concerns. Moreover, Bitcoin spot ETF approval might become a symbol of legitimization of the prime cryptocurrency, attracting more investors to the sector.\n\nA positive decision from the [SEC](https:\/\/coinchapter.com\/tag\/SEC\/) could lead to increased liquidity and stability in the crypto markets. However, it is likely that markets would face some short-term volatility following the influx of capital and speculating trading.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC [approving](https:\/\/coinchapter.com\/sec-grayscale-bitcoin-etf-filing-rejection\/) a Bitcoin or Ethereum spot ETF could result in market participants launching more diverse crypto-based financial products, which would positively impact crypto adoption.\n\nHowever, Ursone warned that the ETF approval would require investors to shift their strategies in options trading. Traders would likely need to adapt to market predictions and leverage volatility while managing risk and implementing protective measures like hedging with futures, etc.\n\n**BTC Price Consolidating Below $38,000**\n\nBulls failed to push BTC price above $38,000, with the token dropping 1.3% to a daily low near $37,170. \n\n[ BTCUSD daily price chart with RSI. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/42gfj4hpa52c1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43f048c90dbe64605e1d23adddee83bdfcef5728)\n\nHowever, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approval news could help the bulls break above the resistance near $38,400. A breakout above the immediate resistance might help BTC price target the resistance near $40,850.\n\nConversely, an increase in selling pressure might see BTC price drop to the support near $35,300. Breaching the immediate support might result in Bitcoin price dropping nearly 12% to test the support near $32,900.\n\nSource [here](https:\/\/coinchapter.com\/bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-approval-deribit\/).","title":"Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF Approval Could Be Pivotal For The Market, Says Deribit Analyst","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700766160,"id":"1828dzw"}

It is used as an indicator to determine market sentiment and the strength behind price trends.\n\nUnlike the total issued shares of a company, which typically remain constant, the number of outstanding futures contracts varies from day to day.\n\nOpen interest is calculated by adding all the contracts from opened trades and subtracting the contracts when a trade is closed\n\nWhile CME retains its position as the leading exchange in terms of Bitcoin futures, the past 24 hours have witnessed a remarkable surge in Ethereum open interest.\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum open interest has escalated by 2.5%, reaching 3.59 million ETH \u2013 the most substantial level since August.

Other content creation reward programs [(Such as Adsense)](https:\/\/support.google.com\/adsense\/answer\/9724?hl=en) often require you to have a certain amount of followers, produce a certain amount of hours worth of content per month, but with Donuts, users can spend as much, or as little time as they desire and be eligible for rewards.\n\n* Low-risk gateway to DeFi\n\nThere is no better way to play around with DeFi, interacting with DEX's and DApps, then by doing so with tokens earned without financial investment. For many users, including myself, DONUTs can serve as project that provide confidence to start interacting with decentralized exchanges, knowing that if a mistake does happen, its only an opportunity cost, rather than an invested cost. \n\n* Community continues to increase its value\n\nAs the community continues to grow and activity, there can be more appeal for advertisers to buy and burn DONUTs  in order to gain our attention, via renting the Banner, or community events such as AMA's or Giveaways. As the community continues to grow, not only will hosting an event look more appealing, reaching a wider audience, but it will also require more DONUTs to be purchased and burned in the process.\n\n* DONUT \u2013 Decentralized Ownership Network Utility Token\n\nUnlike the pilot RCP program officially affiliated with Reddit, DONUTS are decentralized and do not run the same inherent risk that befell Moons\/Bricks.

{"selftext":"Symbiogenesis, an original Ethereum and Polygon game from Final Fantasy creator Square Enix, is set to launch in December.\n\nSquare Enix, the storied video game publisher behind the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts franchises, is gearing up to launch its first original Ethereum NFT game, Symbiogenesis. And now we know when the first NFT mint will take place.\n\nThe Symbiogenesis auction process will begin on Monday, November 27 and span three waves for the first batch of NFT-based characters for the game. The first wave will take place on November 27-28, the second wave will follow from November 30 to December 1, and the final batch will be auctioned from December 2-3.\n\nEarlier this month, Square Enix revealed a [unique approach to the mint](https:\/\/decrypt.co\/204663\/final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-reveals-how-get-nfts-play-symbiogenesis), which can potentially net early users free NFTs\u2014but it depends on the level of demand seen for the assets.\n\nIn total, Square Enix will launch 500 character NFTs for Chapter 1 of Symbiogenesis, with just 10 characters in the first wave, 90 in the second wave, and 400 in the third and final wave. The publisher opened up allowlist access earlier this month, letting users complete various quests and challenges within the game\u2019s Discord chat server to gain access to the auction.\n\nThe Symbiogenesis NFTs will be offered up free to allowlist members in each wave\u2014but if multiple people attempt to claim a certain NFT, then it will go up for auction and prospective buyers can attempt to bid to own the assets in question. Given that approach, it\u2019s currently unclear how likely it\u2019ll be that any of the NFTs will actually be claimed without an auction.\n\n*Billed as a \u201cdigital collectible art project,\u201d Symbiogenesis is an original, narrative-driven game from Square Enix that will revolve around characters minted as Ethereum NFTs, along with items and other NFTs minted on scaling network Polygon. The game is expected to launch in December following the initial NFT mint.*\n\n[Source](https:\/\/decrypt.co\/207381\/heres-when-final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-dropping-nfts-ethereum-game)","title":"Final Fantasy Maker Square Enix Is Dropping NFTs for its Ethereum Game","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700847878,"id":"182xm0g"}

This can be done through:\n\n* personal validator nodes \n* staking on an exchange\n* staking pools\n\nStaking involves locking up ETH to validate transactions on the network.

Total value distributed would go from $28K\/month to $230K\/month.  If people think others are going crazy to earn DONUTs at .012 imagine what happens if DONUTs hit .10.\n\n My biggest concern here isn't that this is capping DONUT price (because as we all know speculators will speculate).  My biggest concern is that if we don't $$ value cap this distribution we are going to get all kinds of bad behavior should the DONUT price rise.\n\n**The above works out to:**\n\n* 26% for LP\n* 59% for sub content\/participation, users\n* 15% for community fund\n* 4% for moderators\n* &#x200B;\n\n# The Solution:\n\n# Reduce DONUT inflation from 2300K\/month to 2000K\/month (inflation ~12%) divided as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 10% 200K to Gnosis DONUT\/xDAI LP providers\n* 20% 400K to L1 DONUT\/WETH LP providers\n* 10% 200K for posters based on reddito data but $$ CAPPED to $6K\/month\n* 7.5% 150K for commentors based on reddit data but $$ CAPPED to $4.5K\/month\n* 7.5% 150K for donut-upvote w\/ quadratic voting $$ CAPPED to $4.5k\/month\n* 5% 100K for donut-upvotes based on quantity of posts tipped $$ CAPPED to $3K\/month\n* 10% 200K for community fund - capped at $6k\/month\n* 10% 200K for development fund - capped at $24K\/month\n* 10% 200K for operational fund - capped at $24K\/month\n* 5% 100K for mods - capped at $12k\/month\n* 5% 100K for Governance Reward Fund - capped at $12k\/month\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:  The $$ value used to feed into the $$ caps will come from an average valuation taken from the LP DONUT valuation of both the LPs daily.  Notice the above does NOT become deflationary until DONUT price hits .03.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Notice the relative %'s are changed to the following:**\n\n* 30% for LP\n* 30% for users\/content\n* 30% for community operations and development\n* 5% for mods\/moderation\n* 5% as governance rewards.\n\n# What changes here if this is passed.\n\n1. 300K drop in DONUT inflation\n2. Shift of 1\/2 the user\/content rewards from users\/content to new funds, development, operations.   We should be paying reddito and matt for their work running the servers\/bots and collecting the data for the DAO).  Seriously does anyone think that cutting rewards for user\/content creation going to change anything.   I personally don't think so.  A number of people have expressed the idea of just cutting user\/content rewards to 0.   While I might favor that, I think cutting rewards by 50% is enough to put a damper on activity,  capping the rewards to $$ value means they can still go up by 50% before they get $$ capped.   It means that rewards as a $$ value decrease somewhat, but can still go up 50% from here, but are then capped.   Put simply it means a modest pay cut to content creators\/users, but it also means a hard $$ cap unless these people hold their DONUTs.\n3. $$ value CAPs on parts of the distribution.\n4. Creation of new earmarked funds for Development, Operations, Governance \n   1. Rewards development (for code or even marketing ideas honestly, for people to work on creating decentralized solutions to our infrastructure, etc.\n   2.  operational fund (to pay for people running servers)\n   3. a governance reward fund. (to pay for yearly governance reports, voting, treasury, and to offer bounties for successful governance proposals)\n\n# The Reasoning:\n\n* Whether the number is 60% or 30% of the distribution rewards I think this change will make little difference to current sub activity.   People have suggested cutting user\/content distributions to 0.  I have advocated for doing that for 3 months just to see if anything changes at all.  This proposal just caps various rewards with a $$ value amount while defining what I see as a better distribution generally for what we are getting.  Do we really need to throw almost 60% of all the distribution at users\/content creators?\n* I believe that paying people for actual positive work is critical and in this respect reddito and matt have stepped up with code and servers to help the sub.   They deserve to be compensated.   We are also going to need backup services in case these very kind individuals need\/decide to stop providing their services which means we are going to need funds to induce these people.   For operational costs I honestly think the $1k\/month might be a low but at least it is a start and the 100K\/month will at least give us some DONUTs to offer as compensation.\n* I also think that posting governance bounties (for proposed and in particular governance proposals that pass deserve some form of bounties).  Lets get a fund together so we can start thinking about offering governance proposal bounties.\n\nBTW:  I think mods are important so in this proposal I have upped the MOD total DONUTs to 100K.   Mostly so we can encourage more people to take on the mod role.   I want to discuss more about what the community wants out of mods, how the should be rewarded, etc.  But I only put in a modest increase there.   What I would like to see the mod group use the extra DONUTs for is a mod of the month award (with 10K DONUTs to go with it) and a 5K runner up.  Who votes for this (probably should be the mods themselves honestl) and\/or who has input to vote, perhaps maybe some of the bigger governance players that aren't mods idk.\n\n# The Negatives:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Less rewards means less activity.  Not clear to me the increased activity has meant anything positive to the sub.  But it is possible some quality\/important contributors decide rewards no longer justify their participation and leave.   The problem here is that we have no real metrics other than users, comments\/posts, and tips as a metric of users.   We already know that we have a sybil\/alt problem and it makes no sense to throw away 1\/6 of the distribution to sybils\/alts when we could use that 1\/6 to compensate people like matt, reddito and others for bringing concrete tangible change to the sub.\n2. It may mean the farmers just work harder to claim more DONUTs pushing good contributors out of the space.   (If this would cause any of our long time or largest contributors from leaving I want to hear from them because part of the community development I imagine going to is curating contribution)\n3. THis proposal won't really change anything.   If that is true - is it a problem - do you have a better solution.  (If you believe it won't change anything behavior wise, then why isn't reducing DONUT inflation somewhat something to vote for - the DONUTs you earn will just go up in value)\n4. We don't want DONUT price to go up.  In fact we should have more inflation not less.  We want the DONUT price to go down with more inflation.   I would be happy to entertain a counter proposal.  One of my main goals here wasn't just to slightly reduce inflation but really to adjust where the distributions are going to compensate people for doing positive work. \n\n# The Positives:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Reduced inflation almost always is a positive for market caps, giving governance more $$ to spend to induce positive change.\n2. We finally created funds to pay people for their positive contributions and any monthly operational expenses.   We can induce people to create backups for existing systems and look for ways to decentralize any new operations.\n3. We spread the $$ rewards around more equitably 1\/3 for LP, 1\/3 for user\/content, 1\/3 for everything else.\n4. Capping rewards at a $$ value means if DONUT price goes up dramatically we don't have an onslaught of additional farming competition.  What is happening now pretty much remains rewarded at roughly the same value as current.\n5. The caps can easily be adjusted\n6. If DONUT price rises above .03 the above initiative would mean reduced DONUT inflation.  If price of DONUTs drops we always still get our 2M DONUTs as a minimum.\n\n# Voting Options:\n\n# [YES] Adjust distribution as described above.   \n\n# [NO] Leave everything the same.\n\n&#x200B;","title":"[Governance Poll Proposal] MONTHLY DONUT DISTRIBUTION CHANGE","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700925421,"id":"183lvmw"}

We are fine now but imagine in bull run when there are 10x more people ... I think this can make the sub look amateurish.  \n\n* **Content quality** \\- Content quality is often questionable and sometimes spammy. On a big news day there is a flood of same or very similar articles non stop. People don't really care if someone posted a content before.. they just try post most recent version of the news burying the initial discussion.  \nNow imagine this when we have 10x more users. Sub will become unusable.  \n\n* **Active community managing** \\- Currently we only have 1-2 active mods that effectively manage community (others are doing the technical stuff). It feels like we need 1-2 more guys that are active throughout the day and are managing DMs, scanning content etc. Once again this is not too big of an issue now.. but it definitely will become in 2024.  \n\n* **No clear rules** \\- there are many many gray areas when it comes to rules. New users cannot easily find rules, and this leads to confusion, on top of that some rules are straight up not being applied, or applied only after community insists on them etc.  \n\n\nIt feels like this is a proper time to address this given the fact that in 1 year from now we will be flooded with new users. And we want them to feel like everything is nice and smooth here... not rusty and old :)  \n\n\nJust my 2 cents, hopefully we can grow this into a fruitful discussion and improve this sweet dognut community :P","title":"It feels like we need more active community management","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700933439,"id":"183ot21"}

{"selftext":"**AMA Announcement: Join Us on November 26th at 19:00 UTC!**\n\nHey r\/ethtrader, thank you for hosting our AMA!\n\nWe are [u\/kekzilla59](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/kekzilla59\/) (\\~Community Manager) and [u\/WarmBiertje](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/WarmBiertje\/) (\\~Developer)\n\nAnd we are the team behind RCAX. Known to some for our real-time Reddit Collectible Avatars market analysis tool and mobile app: [RCAX.io](https:\/\/rcax.io\/). We are driven to improve the Reddit Collectible Avatars ecosystem! If you haven't heard of us, don't worry \u2013 we're here to give you a quick overview!\n\n**About RCAX:**\n\nOur journey kinda started about a year ago when the first Reddit Collectible Avatars were released. Intrigued by the concept of RCAs, [u\/WarmBiertje](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/WarmBiertje\/) began developing snoovatars.com, a real-time price alerts service for Reddit Collectible Avatars. This was the core of the product to come.\n\nFast forward to May this year, and we transformed into [RCAX.io](https:\/\/rcax.io\/), offering a comprehensive dashboard with real-time prices, listings, sales, and other tools for all Reddit Collectible Avatars. And now with a serious goal to improve the Reddit Collectible Avatars ecosystem.\n\n**The Challenge:**\n\nAs Reddit flooded the market with new RCA collections, the community faced challenges. The once-rare avatars lost their appeal, leading to a collapse in secondary markets. Frustrated community members, having invested significantly, were left with an excess of avatars and a stagnant market.\n\n**Our Solution:**\n\nTo revitalize the community, we introduced dApps, a marketplace, and the RCAX token ($RCAX) launched in September. The token can only be mined by burning eligible Reddit Collectible Avatars, providing a unique solution to the oversupply issue. Learn more about the token and how to mine it in our [whitepaper](https:\/\/whitepaper.rcax.io\/).\n\n**What We've Built:**\n\n1. **RCAX.io:** Real-time market analysis and hub for Reddit Collectible Avatars. Also includes custom price alerts, an avatar exporter, a listings browser and a wallet checker. Download the app for [iOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/nl\/app\/rcax\/id6449831133) and [Android](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=io.rcax.rcax&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1), or use it on the [web](https:\/\/rcax.io\/).\n2. **RCAX** **Token:** Mine $RCAX by burning your Reddit Collectible Avatars. Read more [here](https:\/\/whitepaper.rcax.io\/).\n3. **RCA** **dApps:** Explore our first dApp, [Random Avatar Swap](https:\/\/rcax.io\/dapps\/randomavatarswap), allowing you to swap avatars with random other avatars within the same release generation. First swap is free. Afterwards, you pay a fee in $RCAX. Half of the fee goes to avatar providers for the dapp.\n4. **RCA** **Marketplace:** [RCAX Marketplace](https:\/\/marketplace.rcax.io\/) is designed exclusively for Reddit Collectible Avatars, providing a user-friendly platform for buying and selling. With full support for $RCAX of course. Right now the platform is in early-access, but we are working hard to add additional features.\n\n**Ask Us Anything!**\n\nTLDR; In summary, we've crafted exciting tools for Reddit Collectible Avatars, including a newly launched marketplace and the $RCAX token.

But crypto enthusiasts are breathing an audible sigh of relief, saying the deal lifts a lot of the uncertainty hanging over their industry.\n\n*\"It's nice to wake up in crypto and not worry about what will happen with Binance,\"*\n\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Bitwise, said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n*\"2024-2025 is going to be so great.\"*\n\nThe settlement, JPMorgan Chase analysts added in a note, ends \"potential systemic risk emanating from a hypothetical Binance collapse.\"\n\nMichael Safai, a partner with crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital, argued the Binance \"resolution means a path forward for crypto and confidence that the asset class won\u2019t be enforced out of existence.\"\n\nThe movement in cryptocurrencies and related stocks in the aftermath of the Binance announcement showed that investors largely shared that optimism.\n\nBinance\u2019s own crypto token BNB (BNB-USD) was down 13% in the hours after its settlement was announced \u2014 an illustration of its many remaining challenges now that it is under tighter government scrutiny \u2014 but then recovered on Wednesday as the prices of other currencies stabilized.\n\n*THE BULL CASE*\n\nThe bull case for crypto is that the worst of its problems are now in the rearview mirror.\n\nBitcoin peaked at $68,789 in November 2021 but then crashed in 2022 as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates and a series of firms imploded, including crypto exchange FTX in November 2022.\n\nA widespread crackdown on the crypto industry followed. Regulators sued a number of big players, including Coinbase and Binance. Earlier this month a jury convicted FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of defrauding customers, lenders, and investors.\n\nNow investors are newly optimistic that the industry is poised for wider acceptance and regulatory clarity from Washington. They are hoping the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon grant approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is among the big-name money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product. Grayscale Investments is also pushing the SEC to sign off on the conversion of its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund following an August decision in its favor from a three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.\n\n*READ MORE:* https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/where-crypto-goes-next-after-the-humbling-of-binance-210819375.html","title":"Where crypto goes next after the humbling of Binance","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700959725,"id":"183ybls"}

{"selftext":"This post for newbies who hasn't added liquidity to LP (either on mainnet or Gnosis). The screenshots are taken from Donut\/wXDai pool on Gnosis. \n\n*I have used Metamask Android app and MetaMask's built-in browser to complete this task of adding LP and stake them*\n\nLet's talk about these 3 pics one by one. These 3 pics are broken pieces of one big lengthy screenshot of single page from the [staking section of Donut-dashboard.com](https:\/\/donut-dashboard.com\/#\/stake):\n\n**Pic 1:** Since I have added the LP tokens few hours go, there are 29+ Donuts ready to harvest. Upon clicking that button, I can get all those Donuts to my wallet after signing a tx on Metamask. You don't have to do everyday, send them to wallet wherever you want them, because every time you harvest, there's a very small tx fee (truly negligible though). \n\nThere's another button Withdraw staked LP tokens - upon clicking you can withdraw your LP from staking and then remove liquidity from pool at Honeyswap (for xDai pair on Gnosis) or at Uniswap (for WETH pair on mainnet). It's the same button to stake your LP tokens. \n\nLP Token is a token you'll receive after adding liquidity on Honeyswap (Gnosis) or Uniswap (mainnet). Add them to the staking website for staking rewards. \n\n**Pic 2:** It shows how many Donuts (73+) you'll get per day if you stake LP tokens (1796+) of 20020 Donuts and 228 xDai. The number of Donuts and it's pair xDai or WETH will keep changing according the price of those tokens (Donuts, WETH, xDai (stablecoin)). \n\nIn this example, when Donut's price increases, you'll get more xDai and less Donuts in your LP. When price decreases, you'll have more Donuts and less xDai in your LP. **That's the Impermanent Loss** you have read everywhere. If the price pumps harder, you'll lose the opportunity to have more profit if you add all tokens to LP. That's where high staking rewards will compensate your impermanent loss in long term. \n\nWhen the price moves sideways for too long, you'll have more profit than when price pumps high or dumps harder. \n\n**Pic 3:** It shows the total number LP tokens added to staking. LP tokens consist of xDai and Donuts added to the pool. You can also see the staking yield rate in APY - massive 67%+ per year, which is approximately 0.184% every day. \n\nDue to the impermanent loss, I don't recommend you to add all your Donuts to LP and staking. But Keep some part of your Donut stash to LP and staking so that you'll have very good rewards in long term.\n\nPro-tip: when price dips heavily, you can remove LP and convert rest of the XDAI to Donut and have more Donuts in you bag for cheap price. It's called dip buying (DCA) through LP \ud83d\ude09\n\nI could have made this post like a tutorial for beginners on desktop. But this post added from phone. Maybe I have missed something to add in this post.

{"selftext":"Hello my fellow EthTrader members, I constantly see this comment for why people don't farm airdrops: 'It's too much time, too much effort..'\n\nIn this Guide, I show you how **Bridging on certain sites** may allow you to qualify for 5, or even 6 different L2 drops - and lay out the **best bridges (with lowest fees)** and the **steps on how to farm different L2, and which L2s you can farm** with those bridges\n\n**1. Orbiter Finance** ([Orbiter.finance](https:\/\/Orbiter.finance))\n\nThis is no surprise this is on the list, because Orbiter is highly popular for **low gas fees for bridging**. At 20 gwei and below (check [https:\/\/etherscan.io\/gastracker](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/gastracker)) it c**osts about $1 or less to bridge between different layer 2s**.\n\n**i) Layer 2s (that has not launched a token) eligible to farm** : **LINEA, BASE, ZKSYNC, StarkNet, PolygonZKEVM, Manta, SCROLL, ZORA**\n\n**ii)** **Steps:** All the L2s can be farmed on the same metamask wallet. **Simply Bridge Eth** (preferably **minimum $100 or more** to increase your volume) **to and from the different** L2s (e.g LINEA -> ZKSYNC, ZKSYNC -> PolygonZKEVM, PolygonZKEVM -> SCROLL, SCROLL back to Linea etc etc).\n\nKey here is to make sure the blockchain you are farming has a 'record' (e.g **bridging out of the L2** which records a transaction)\n\niii) **Bonus points for Orbiter: Orbiter themselves** have hinted an airdrop, so imagine **TRIPLE FARMING** when you make a bridge there!\n\n**2.** **Rhino.Fi** ([https:\/\/app.rhino.fi\/](https:\/\/app.rhino.fi\/))\n\nRhino.FI has a seamless UI, low gas fees (similar to Orbiter), very easy to use and is in my favourites as well. Plenty of tokens you can farm there just like Orbiter!\n\n**i) Layer 2s (that has not launched a token) eligible to farm** : **LINEA, BASE, ZKSYNC, StarkNet, PolygonZKEVM, Manta, SCROLL**\n\n**ii) Steps: Same as Orbiter, see above**\n\n**(iii) Bonus points for Rhino**: There's **0 platform fees for bridging into same L2s** at the moment. They also have **tracker for you to check your score for different airdrops** (although it's very generic and doesn't go into detail I must say)\n\n**3. Owlto (** [https:\/\/owlto.finance\/bridge](https:\/\/owlto.finance\/bridge) )\n\nA third bridge which supports all the L2s, similar to the first 2 options, and also with low gas fees. \n\nRecommended after you complete the first 2 options, and want to 'interact with more protocols' to increase the number of contract interactions for your L2 farming (which is one of the qualifying airdrop criterias,although a less important one)\n\nThere you have it, killing 5 or 6 'birds' in one stone - **you can farm 5\/6 different L2 protocols within 10 minutes simply by looking at step 2** (for either Orbiter or Rhino.fi) above!\n\n**Pro-tips:**\n\n1) Low gas fees for bridging (\\~around $1) apply for: 1) **Low gwei (around 20 or below) and 2) Bridges Between L2s - for this reason, I always avoid bridging from the Eth mainnet.**\n\n2) For some protocols like ZKSYNC, it is recommended you use their native bridge ([https:\/\/portal.txsync.io\/bridge\/](https:\/\/portal.txsync.io\/bridge\/)) **at least once (high gas fees, and from Eth Mainnet)** which could be an airdrop criteria.\n\nAfter using the **native bridge for ZKSYNC once,** use the bridges with low fees (the ones mentioned above) to bridge between L2s.\n\nAs far as I know there are no such 'native bridges' for BASE\/PolygonZKEVM\/LINEA, so you can avoid the crazy high fees for those.\n\n3) It is recommended you (at least) either: 1) Bridge once a week or 2) Swap once a week for a protocol you are farming - to r**ecord transactions on the relevant L2 for consecutive weeks.**\n\n4) As mentioned above, I will repeat this again since **this is important\\*\\*** \\- **if you don't have much time, just log ontoOrbiter or Rhino and make bridges across 5 or 6 different protocols, it can be done under 10 minutes a week and potentially qualify you across different drops !**\n\nAnd there you have it folks. The argument of 'not enough time' crushed - 10 minutes in a week can potentially qualify you for 5 or 6 different L2s all on the same website.\n\nPlease engage, and leave your comments - I will try to answer you to the best of my abilities (and I'm sure there are other 'experts' around in EthTrader!'","title":"The Ultimate Beginner's Guide for BRIDGING: How to qualify for 5-6 different 'airdrops' in one Stone !","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700979261,"id":"1844aaz"}

{"selftext":"Square Enix, the renowned publisher behind the \u201cFinal Fantasy\u201d series, is set to initiate an NFT auction for its latest project, \u201cSymbiogenesis,\u201d in the coming week, according to a social media announcement.\n\nSymbiogenesis is built on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchain networks. It marks the company\u2019s first foray into the Web3 gaming ecosystem.\n\nNFT Auction\n\nThe auction will unfold in three phases starting from Nov. 27.  Each phase will offer participants a unique opportunity to acquire digital collectibles integral to the game\u2019s experience.\n\nEach auction phase will cater to different groups based on their involvement in the Allow List Entry Campaign held in November. The first phase is an exclusive sale of 10 NFTs to associates, with each wallet limited to one NFT.\n\nIn the second phase, 90 NFTs will be available for top-ranking participants from the Allow List Entry Campaign, also with a one NFT per wallet limit. The final phase opens up the sale of 400 NFTs to all campaign participants, with no purchase limit and a broader range of NFT categories.\n\nThese phases are scheduled: Phase 1 from Nov. 27 to Nov. 28, Phase 2 from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1, and Phase 3 from Dec. 2 to Dec. 3.\n\nEligibility and ranking in these phases are determined by the participants\u2019 engagement in social media, Discord activities, and possession of SYMBIOGENESIS relics (NFTs), emphasizing active community involvement.\n\nAdditionally, higher-ranking participants in the campaign have the chance to receive free character NFTs during the second phase. This structure highlights Square Enix\u2019s focus on integrating community participation with the NFT auction process.\n\nSymbiogenesis\n\nSymbiogenesis is touted as a digital collectible art project, blending traditional gaming elements with the burgeoning field of NFTs. Notably, the game\u2019s ending is not predetermined, offering three players the chance to shape the final outcome based on their in-game achievements.\n\nPlayers can engage with Symbiogenesis and follow the main storyline without purchasing NFTs. However, owning an NFT character unlocks additional content and the chance to influence the game\u2019s ending.\n\nUnlike traditional NFT launches, Square Enix will release these digital assets in limited quantities alongside each new story chapter, gradually unveiling the game world.\n\nThe NFTs in Symbiogenesis serve multiple purposes: from being key to unlocking narrative elements to being tradeable assets on the blockchain. Square Enix also emphasizes the role of its Discord server in the game\u2019s community, offering exclusive roles and rewards for active participation.\n\nThe gameplay is divided into six chapters, each with its missions and quests. Players will navigate through a variety of game modes, including daily rewards, missions, and quests, all accessible through an intuitive menu system.\n\nNFTs play a crucial role in this ecosystem, offering hints and achievements and being convertible from in-game items.\n\n\nLink\ud83d\udc47\n\n:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/japanese-giant-squareenix-to-launch-nft-auction-for-new-web3-game-built-on-ethereum-polygon\/","title":"\ud83d\ude80Japanese giant SquareEnix to launch NFT auction for new Web3 game built on Ethereum, Polygon","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1700980880,"id":"1844pc3"}

{"selftext":"The crypto markets entered a mild retracement last Wednesday following the news of Changpeng Zhao\u2019s exit from Binance as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the US SEC. But away from the sensational headlines, recent on-chain data trends show that Ethereum recorded a significant number of new user addresses.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s New Addresses chart below shows that in the aftermath of the news events, 94,451 new ETH addresses were created on the Ethereum network.\n\nNotably, a closer look at the chart clearly shows that the last time Ethereum recorded this much traction from new entrants was 5 months ago, back in July 2023.\n\nBy summing up new Ethereum wallets created daily, the New Addresses metric tracks the rate at which the blockchain network attracts new users. Typically, an increase in new wallets logically means that users are creating new accounts. As these new wallets begin to carry out transactions, it increases market demand for ETH.\n\nHowever, the timing of this spike in new ETH wallets suggests that the milestone occurred in relation to the leadership upheaval at Binance.\n\nIt appears that, in a bid to avoid feared sanctions, fund seizures, or other forms of operational frailties, a huge number of Ethereum users shifted their funds from Binance into other trading platforms or alternative storage options.\n\nRather than panic-selling their holdings and closing out their positions, the spike in ETH New Addresses on November 20 shows that investors instead shifted their coins into fresh wallets.\n\nThis shows that crypto investors are confident that the SEC\u2019s $4.3 billion hammering of Binance and CZ\u2019s ouster are unlikely to have a lasting negative impact on the broader cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThis display of resilience further affirms the Ethereum markets\u2019 maturity and investors\u2019 confidence in the long-term viability of the broader crypto economy. If the bulls can capitalize on this dominant bullish sentiment, they could drive ETH price closer to $2,500 in the days ahead.\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.fxempire.com\/forecasts\/article\/ethereum-sets-record-eth-price-2500-1391276","title":"Ethereum Sets Record With 94,000 New Users \u2013 Will it Drive ETH Price to $2,500?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1700981697,"id":"1844wow"}

This unique approach aims to decentralize the Blur NFT marketplace, giving control to the community \u2014 a distinctive strategy when compared to competitors like OpenSea, which operates without a token and relies on private investors.\n\nThe platform has recorded a decent level of success since its launch, thanks to its user-friendly interface, low fees, and enhanced liquidity for NFTs. \n\nNotably, Blur rewards its users with BLUR tokens through airdrops, creating a symbiotic relationship with its trader community.\n\nIn a recent airdrop, a pseudonymous NFT trader claimed a staggering $13.6 million in BLUR tokens. This reward, part of a 300 million token pool, reinforces Blur\u2019s commitment to rewarding its active user base and has contributed to the project\u2019s success so far.","title":"Binance listing triggers a 75% price surge for Blur","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1701004465,"id":"184agmr"}

{"selftext":"While the newest Ethereum second-layer platform Blast is growing day by day, some crypto enthusiasts raise concerns about its security, tokenomical design and even the very \"L2\" status. The Blast team had kept silence for five days, but then explained the benefits of its multi-signature solution.\n\nEthereum L2 Blast sees $500 million deposited, DefiLlama says\n\nEthereum staking platform Blast registered its total value locked (TVL) metric spiking above $500 million in equivalent. By press time, Blast depositors injected over $512,810,000 in its contract, DefiLlama data says.Image by DefiLlama\n\nLaunched on Nov. 21, it amassed the first $100 million in less than 24 hours, which makes it arguably the fastest-growing blockchain network by TVL.\n\nAs per data of 21 Shares' dashboard on Dune Analytics (which, unlike DefiLlama, sees Blast's TVL at \"only\" $382 million in equivalent), the network managed to surpass Consensys' Linea, Starknet, Polygon zkEVM, dYdX Chain and is on its way to leaving Coinbase-incubated Base in the dust.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Blast promotes itself as the first-ever Ethereum L2 with native yield. It restakes all injected money in Lido Finance and rewards depositors with payouts and Blast Points. Also, Blast stablecoin depositors can benefit from Maker's tokenized T-bills program.\n\nThe protocol yielded $20 million by a clutch of high-reputable VCs, including the likes of Paradigm, Standard Crypto and Primitive Ventures, with the participation of heavy-hitting angel investors Andrew Kang and Santiago Santos.\n\n\"Multisigs can be highly effective if used properly\": Blast team dismisses criticism\n\nAt the same time, since the launch of its \"early access\" phase, the protocol has been heavily criticized by the cryptocurrency community for its centralization and Ponzi-like tokenomics.\n\nSome skeptics opined that Blast looks like a single-node sidechain secured by a multi-sig contract instead of being a proper L2.\n\nOn Nov. 25, representatives of Blast (which is believed to be founded by Blur NFT marketplace key figurehead Tieshun \"Pacman\" Roquerre) shared a thread to dismiss the concerns about multi-sig risks.\n\nThey stressed that upgradeable contracts protected by multi-sig solutions are much safer than stable contracts. In the case of Blast, the multi-sig is in the right hands:\n\nYou want to make sure that each signing key of a multisig is independently secure. This helps make the multisig antifragile. Each key should be in cold storage, managed by an independent party, and geographically separated (...) For Blast, each signer has exactly those properties. They are deeply technical engineers who have experience with high stakes applications ranging from financial applications to smart contracts.\n\nAlso, the Blast team teased a security update coming next week: One of the multi-sig addresses hardware wallet provider will be changed.\n\nRead more: https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/news\/u_today:8223c35f4094b:0-blast-l2-tvl-over-500-million-team-addresses-centralization-criticism\/","title":"ETH L2 Blast TVL surpassed $500 Million, Team Addresses Centralization Criticism.

But away from the sensational headlines, recent on-chain data trends show that Ethereum recorded a significant number of new user addresses.\nGlassnode\u2019s New Addresses chart below shows that in the aftermath of the news events, 94,451 new ETH addresses were created on the Ethereum network.\n\nNotably, a closer look at the chart clearly shows that the last time Ethereum recorded this much traction from new entrants was 5 months ago, back in July 2023.\n\nBy summing up new Ethereum wallets created daily, the New Addresses metric tracks the rate at which the blockchain network attracts new users. Typically, an increase in new wallets logically means that users are creating new accounts.

Do you have any other platforms in mind?\n\n**Q4:** Will you participate in the forum, if we ban copy pasta content (even if you add source link)? All you have to do is type real content and sometimes copy pasta some part of the content and add links (This independent forum will rely on Search Engine traffic for ad revenue, and search engines won't like plagiarism!)\n\nAs I have said before, I will start setting up the website and will add original content to gain some initial influx of users and traffic. I will be updating about the journey on EthTrader forum. I will be talking to EthTrader community members on Daily Discussions, Main page (through posts) and on Discord server of EthTrader.\n\nI will be giving first and utmost preference to the feedback and suggestions of EthTrader members and devs. Let's hope this will be the birth of a strong and independent crypto community on the web.

{"selftext":"According to CryptoQuant\u2019s data on November 4th, Ethereum (ETH) achieved a significant milestone. The aggregate amount of funds staked in the Ethereum 2.0 smart contract has experienced a notable surge, reaching a commendable sum of $32 million.\n\nThe current increase in value is indicative of a larger pattern in which investors are consistently and proactively investing in ETH, thereby propelling the Ethereum ecosystem to unprecedented levels of growth.\n\nIn the broader context of the year 2023, Ethereum\u2019s exceptional performance is clearly observable, as it has contributed a significant $74.5 billion to its market value thus far this year.\n\nThe jump in market capitalization recorded at the beginning of the year on January 1 marks a significant gain of 51% from the initial value of $146 billion.\n\nThe latest data trends from on-chain sources also reveal a significant rise in the number of new user addresses for Ethereum. This demonstrates the platform\u2019s ability to withstand the unexpected departure of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and the consequent minor decline in cryptocurrency markets that occurred last Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, Ethereum (ETH) demonstrated a noteworthy resurgence as it successfully regained the price level of $2,100. This quick recovery occurred following the instability caused by the resignation of Zhao and the $4.3 billion settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe consistently changing market dynamics draw attention to the possible consequences of the increase in user activity, prompting investors and analysts to observe the trajectory of Ethereum.\n\nOn the hourly chart, the price of Ethereum (ETH) currently resides within the central region of the local channel, indicating a state of equilibrium. This suggests that the market is gathering momentum and preparing for a potential significant price movement in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, upon examining Glassnode\u2019s New Addresses chart, it becomes evident that there has been a notable increase in the user population of Ethereum. Specifically, the Ethereum network witnessed the creation of 94,451 fresh ETH addresses subsequent to recent news occurrences.\n\nUpon further analysis of the chart, a significant insight emerges: the most recent occurrence of Ethereum witnessing a substantial influx of new participants took place in July 2023.\n\nThe provided data highlights a notable increase in interest and engagement within the Ethereum ecosystem, indicating a significant influx of players that has not been observed since the middle of the year.\n\nArticle\nhttps:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum-user-tsunami-record-94000-new-accounts-and-32-million-in-staked-funds\/","title":"Ethereum User Tsunami: Record 94,000 New Accounts And $32 Million In Staked Funds","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":2,"created":1701087842,"id":"1851s61"}
{"selftext":"What is Network Effect?\n\nA network effect is a phenomenon where an increased number of participants in a system increases the value or utility of the underlying network and the service it underpins. The phenomenon results in users deriving more value from the service as more users join the network, creating a positive feedback loop that induces more demand for the service. In short, network effects make a product more useful as more people join its underlying network.\n\nNetwork effects have often been illustrated by the example of the telephone: A single telephone is useless, but the utility of the telephone network increases with each new telephone added. As the total number of connections a given node (telephone) can establish increases, the utility of the network is enhanced. Similarly, the more users a social media platform can attract, the more valuable it may become as a service to connect with others. The effect is comparable with payment networks such as VISA or ridesharing networks like Uber\u2014the greater the number of users, the more valuable the network.\n\n[ The more users the telephone network can amass, the more valuable it becomes. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oo9szvws0w2c1.png?width=4001&format=png&auto=webp&s=74e5fa2e2e3e3e2122478d865c2c26c12972934e)\n\nNow copy that and paste into Web3 and crypto services. One of the reasons why Ethereum is so successful is its massive ecosystem and its Network Effect.\n\nWe often hear \"the next ETH killer will be XYZ\" but taking on such gargantuan that ETH has become it's not an easy task. And it keeps growing faster and faster every day.\n\nIf we compare Internet adoption to crypto adoption those two graphs looks very similar. It is predicted that crypto will have around 1 billion users around 2025\/26 and the Network Effect will become stronger and stronger:\n\n[Internet vs. Crypto Adoption](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/isrgp7jo1w2c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=1afd066487ae4d5ae5b7d3e13a48c78020c73fb4)\n\nSources:\n\n[https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/internet-vs-crypto-adoption-chart-predicts-1-billion-users-by-2027\/](https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/internet-vs-crypto-adoption-chart-predicts-1-billion-users-by-2027\/)\n\n[https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/n\/network-effect.asp](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/n\/network-effect.asp)\n\n[https:\/\/chain.link\/education-hub\/web3-network-effects](https:\/\/chain.link\/education-hub\/web3-network-effects)\n\n&#x200B;","title":"The Importance of Network Effects in Web3","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1701090091,"id":"1852g15"}

We chose processing at this time for 2 reasons\n\n1. Calculations are performed against 'karma' earned for posts and comments only and after pay2post has been deducted.  We could have chosen to perform the tip calculation at the tail end of the workflow (which would have included tipping bonuses, governance bonuses, etc) but decided right now was the optimal place in the workflow.  Doing so after the tip bonus calculation would have made the process possible to 'game' by getting bonuses for all the tips you send and have the tips deducted from those bonuses.  In other words, it would have been possible for a user to do nothing but tip in a round and have all the tips materialize due to the bonus from sending so many tips.  In other words, you must 'earn' the right to send these tips.\n2. Coincidently, this is also the easiest place in the workflow to add the calculations with respect to 'legacy' code\n\nThe process begins by looking at all [funded accounts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/17xr46b\/donutbot_update_20231117_change_log\/) and applying those values to the correct account\/balances and creates messages in the log:\n\n    begin applying funded accounts...\n    processing funded account: [user]: mattg1981 [amount]: 1.0 [token]: DONUT [tx_hash]: 0xc75b3243e68af67be421a987c6e95484b85431ab4ff51471462b2e4c6ed715be\n    previous [points]: 4531 -> new [points]: 4532.0\n    \n    processing funded account: [user]: aminok [amount]: 100.0 [token]: DONUT [tx_hash]: 0xfa2ec1a0647a8315de5a27bff8a2e489bae55a3b732596a5a0c06b9cb8704f36\n    previous [points]: 13653 -> new [points]: 13753.0\n    \n    processing funded account: [user]: aminok [amount]: 60000.0 [token]: DONUT [tx_hash]: 0x31af40d99f61d5aadb2ef3ce7b2494ffa5f93b3b1e534eed4959c9fbec05521b\n    previous [points]: 13753.0 -> new [points]: 73753.0\n    \n    completed funded accounts\n\nThese transaction can be verified on the blockchain.

{"selftext":"Ethereum transactions fees WILL get cheaper, slowly with each upgrade and Full Danksharding expected to arrive in a few years! For now, let's talk about the next upgrade which is a step towards Full Danksharding, Proto Sharding!\n\n# What is Sharding?\n\nSharding divides the blockchain network into partitions or smaller units referred to as \u201cshards\u201d, which can independently process transactions. The parallel processing of data will enhance the capacity\/performance of the Ethereum blockchain network to lower congestion and reduce gas fees, resulting in scalability.\n\n# What is Danksharding?\n\nDanksharding introduces \u201cblobs\u201d which are Binary Large Objects to help increase the transaction throughput by increasing the processing speed of transactions to roughly 100,000 TPS (transactions per second)!\n\n# What is Proto-Danksharding?\n\nLayer-2 (L2) rollups has been the current\/temporary solution to the high transaction gas fees on Layer-1 or mainnet. The L2 rollups were modified from execution of shards with each shard processing all transactions to Danksharding with each shard only storing transaction data executed by rollups.\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum Cancun upgrade will focus on Proto-Danksharding which sets up the architecture for full Danksharding in the years to come. Data in blobs will automatically delete after a fixed time period and will not be accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, resulting in lower costs to transmit data on rollups and thus reduced transaction gas fees for the end user. This upgrade will continue to reduce gas fees and increase throughput of transactions.\n\n# EIP-4844 and Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade\n\nEIP-4844 proposes a new type of transaction we discussed earlier called blobs. Blobs can be attached to Ethereum transactions up to 128 KB which is inexpensive when comparing to the current calldata, making blobs a cost-effective remedy for improving rollup data costs, thus lowering end user transaction gas fees. \n\nMoreover, the blob transactions also allow for implementation of execution-layer logic, 2-D fee market, and verification rules which are required for the full Danksharding to come. These updates provide a foundation and architecture of full Danksharding and making Ethereum network scalable.\n\n# When will EIP-4844 be implemented?\n\nThe release was estimated to be Q3-Q4 of 2023, but has been pushed to estimated Q1 of 2024!\n\nI am extremely excited for the EIP-4844 proposal and wanted to share with everyone the highlights! This upgrade will get us 1 step closer to the Ethereum network being scalable to the global population! \n\n*Share below your thoughts on the EIP-4844 proposal!*","title":"Ethereum gas fees WILL get cheaper - EIP-4844 and Proto-Danksharding discussion","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":4,"created":1701108421,"id":"1859bj5"}

{"selftext":"The Ethereum price has been trading more than 50% below its all-time high of $4,800 for the better part of a year now with no sign of returning to its previous all-time high. However, this slow trend may not continue for much longer as a crypto analyst has identified a pattern that could trigger a rally to its previous highs.\n\nEthereum Stuck Inside A Bullish Triangle\nIn an analysis that was posted on TradingView, crypto analyst FieryTrading identified a unique pattern that the Ethereum price has been trading in for almost two years. This pattern is a bullish triangle pattern and it has persisted for more than one and a half years.\n\n\n Happens If ETH Breaks Out Of This Pattern?\nAs the crypto analyst highlights, a breakout of this pattern would lead to a massive rally. The top of this breakout rally could eventually see the Ethereum price return to its 2021 all-time high levels, reaching above $4,800.\n\n\nOn its own this year, the Ethereum price has performed quite well, especially over the last 30 days. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that ETH\u2019s price has risen 16.53% in one month to break above the $2,000 resistance which has now turned into support.\n\nEthereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of approximately $250 billion.\nDo you think ETH will rally to ATH?\n\nSource\n\nhttps:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/news\/ethereum\/ethereum-return-to-4800-ath\/","title":"Ethereum Return To $4,800: Analyst Identifies Pattern To Trigger Rally To ATH","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1701136542,"id":"185kig1"}

{"selftext":"# Introduction:\n\n Hello traders, its ya boy ASingleGuitarString.\n\nAlmost every time I make a chart analysis post I get a similar reaction from somebody. I know some people post technical analysis and they use specific terms and all sorts of arrows. They make predictions on price based on the charts and they throw around terms most people may not understand. \n\nPeople may confuse my chart analysis posts for those types of posts and while I do have my opinions about price movement, which I give in my posts, my posts are meant more to show price levels and identify major and minor resistances and support lines in a simplified way for the common man and to explain and compare sudden price movement.\n\nMy posts attempt to give multiple possible outcomes and explain how each outcome could come to fruition.\n\n**\"Is it a good time to buy Ethereum?\"**\n\nA question I see asked a lot from newbies is \"Is this a good time to buy?\". the usual response from other newbies is \"Just continue to DCA.\" or \"Time in the market beats timing the market\". By identifying key support levels you ensure that you have a good entry position for a possible rise or fall. And by identifying important resistances you can attempt to minimize loses. \n\nWith my posts you can learn the important price levels that may help you plan your DCA or position yourself for a trade.\n\n# Ethereum chart analysis:\n\n**1 year chart:**\n\nCurrent Price of ETH while writing is $2025.8\n\n[Nov. 27th 2022 - Nov. 27th 2023.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6giapwcwpz2c1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d49113356ebcdbb4b61d6f6e5daaa5a1fc62cf)\n\nI know these aren't lines you are use to seeing in a \"technical analysis\" post but this is how I map important price levels and significant price movements on a chart. Some price levels have been identified in the past going back way further than one year.\n\nI color coordinated the important price levels for easier visibility.\n\nThis year Ethereum has had 3 important price levels.  above $1557, above $1779 and above $1940. some people have different number at the same level but these are the numbers I have shown for quick reference.\n\nI have $1175 and $2233 marked as a possible leg up or a disastrous possible crash based on 1 year movement. \n\n**Upward and onward!:**\n\nEthereum has on an up trend starting from January 4th 2023 when it escaped the $1175 price level and  has consistently been rising and passing major price points all year long.\n\nAs many have already been predicting. Ethereum's chart has been looking very good for continued growth.  \n\nWhen comparing it to bitcoins chart you can see the similarities in upward price movement in the 1 year chart.\n\n[Bitcoin 1 year chart: Nov. 27th 2022 - Nov. 27th 2023.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3ze6urzzwz2c1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee9de2fcd58166aca6e6428549b1155f55e0ba1f)\n\nWe could very well be in a slow start to a bull market. A massive pump that in my opinion should have happened last year but the FTX collapse put a halt to it.\n\nThere's no fud in sight and Ethereum is maintaining prices above important resistances. Put your seat belts on. we might take off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PEACE!!!","title":"$2500 in sight. Are we getting ready for blast off?

I hope you enjoy the reading and if you have tips to improve, feel free to tell me so that I can do better in the next post.\n\n# Vitalik Buterin\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7iddtdcyc23c1.jpg?width=378&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91811a829c5cdac6e32e4ef835cc6d1cafb4eb9b\n\n* Twitter (X): [https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin](https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin)\n* LinkedIn: [https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/vitalik-buterin-267a7450](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/vitalik-buterin-267a7450)\n* Vitalik Buterin's Website: [https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/](https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/)\n* Ethereum: [https:\/\/ethereum.org\/](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/)\n\n# Who is he and how he got in Ethereum?\n\nVitalik Buterin born in 1994 is a Russian-Canadian programmer that first heard about Bitcoin from his father in 2021. He was only 17 years old when he had downplayed the idea of Bitcoin as a result of its lack of intrinsic value. In his second encounter, he started to understand the essence of Bitcoin and that it could balance the playing field.\n\nHe was too young back then so he has no financial or computing resources to mine or buy Bitcoin so he decided to work and get paid in Bitcoin. He was paid 5 BTC for each post contributed for online Bitcoin forums. He later met Mihai Alisie and co-founded [Bitcoin Magazine](https:\/\/bitcoinmagazine.com\/) in 2011.\n\nHe started playing more with Bitcoin tech and contributed to a project called Colored Coins which aimed to represent real world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. After a time playing with Bitcoin he realized that a new network built from scratch was necessary to evade the Bitcoin protocol restrictions.\n\nThis is when Ethereum was born. He published the [Ethereum white paper](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/whitepaper\/) in November 2013.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5s17wvs4d23c1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5112f9b1d8352fbf5a9400958ac707c955e9bf58\n\n# Role\n\nHe is the primary Founder of Ethereum and the one who came out with the idea of it. Vitalik initially assumed a leadership role with some hesitation. Over time, however, he has demonstrated his proficiency as a leader. His youthful energy, passion, and the compelling concept behind Ethereum have made him an inspirational figure. Also his commitment to Ethereum is unquestionable. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q51996boc23c1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b740a27dc721bc93967107082b5425f312e50bd5\n\n# After Ethereum, there is no after\n\nCurrently he is still working on Ethereum as one of the last remaining founder from the 8 initial ones. However he tried to take a backseat in recent years, to focus on Ethereum 2.0 which shows that he cares more of the tech than fame. Currently, he has shown that he is becoming more and more mature as ETH CEO showing that he is not too nervous in interviews, etc.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/02hhjttid23c1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81596c339b2eb94a51a0f9998db8b5edf4854e5a\n\n&#x200B;","title":"Ethereum Founders: Vitalik Buterin","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1701166634,"id":"185stse"}

{"selftext":"\n\n\u201cRally from the October 12 low, should be wrapping up its last (blue) W-iv and W-v to ideally $2125-2150, but possibly as high as $2175-2330. See Figure 1 below. Although extensions are always possible, at this stage, the upper end of that 2nd target zone seems a bit of a stretch, and our focus is thus on the happy intermediate: $2150+\/-25.\u201d\n\nFast forward, and ETH topped out at $2136 a day after our update was posted. It declined to $1916 a week later and now trades in the $2050s. Thus, our forecast for a local around $2150+\/-25 and the anticipated subsequent decline was correct.:\n\n\u201cOnce the grey W-i completes, we should expect a pullback for grey W-ii to ideally around the 50-62% retrace of W-i. A typical target zone for a 2nd wave, $1770-1845.\u201d\n\nSince corrections are often complex price patterns with lots of dips and rips (A, B, and C-waves), we have labeled the secondary price high at $2133 on November 24 as (orange) W-b of grey W-ii. We still need a daily close below $1910 to confirm this path. Still, given all the negative divergences on the daily Technical Indicators (TIs, red dotted arrows), the downside should be favored over the upside. Moreover, we would like to see these TIs become oversold to allow for better confirmation of W-ii and a better low-risk entry point.\n\nThus, our short-term expectation that ETH was wrapping up its more minor 4th and 5th wave to ideally $2150+\/-25 followed by a pullback to ideally around $1800+\/-50 was validated, and as such, we continue to expect Ethereum to reach that lower target zone. Once attained, it can launch into its \u201c3rd of a 3rd wave\u201d to new All-Time Highs. In the long term, the cryptocurrency must stay above the June 2022 low ($883), with a severe warning to the Bulls below the October 12 low at $1521, to allow this Bullish path to unfold. \nsource:-https:\/\/in.investing.com\/analysis\/ethereums-local-top-in-200603566","title":"Ethereum\u2019s Local Top In?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1701225677,"id":"186emge"}

{"selftext":" *Ethereum price recovered from the $1,985 zone. ETH is showing positive signs and might rise further if it clears the $2,075 resistance.*\n\n* Ethereum is recovering higher from the $1,985 zone.\n* The price is trading above $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n* There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH\/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n* The pair could gain bullish momentum if it stays above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\n## Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Increase\n\nEthereum price spiked before the $2,000 support before the bulls appeared. ETH traded as low as $1,986 and recently started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a decent increase above the $2,020 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,132 swing high to the $1,986 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH\/USD.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $2,040 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $2,075 zone. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,132 swing high to the $1,986 low.\n\nThe first key resistance is near the $2,100 level. The next resistance sits at $2,130. A clear move above the $2,130 level could send the price toward the $2,150 resistance zone.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mdvk0zgrk83c1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af518985a25c4be879591a3fc8f0184f538a4ce1\n\nThe next resistance is near $2,220, above which the price could aim for a move toward the $2,265 level. Any more gains could start a wave toward the $2,320 level.\n\n## Another Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,075 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,045 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, below which the bears might gain strength.\n\nThe next key support is $2,000. A downside break below $2,000 might spark a strong bearish move. The key support is now at $1,930, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $1,880 level in the near term.\n\n**Technical Indicators**\n\nHourly MACD **\u2013** The MACD for ETH\/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI **\u2013** The RSI for ETH\/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,045\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,075\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.newsbtc.com\/analysis\/eth\/ethereum-price-recovers-2075\/)","title":"Ethereum Price Recovers, Why 100 SMA Is The Key To Fresh Increase","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1701241641,"id":"186jk70"}

I've only include it in my DCA and holdings a few months back, when I joined this sub.\n\nSince then, I tried to collect all the information I could, and sometimes I found funny\/curious things that I have the impression are not very common out there, at least among newbies like me \ud83d\ude43\n\nI thought it would be fun sharing a few, with the hope you can share more if you like (I'm sure there are a lot more!) \ud83d\ude03\n\n(I warn you, some may be unknown only to super Noob like me \ud83d\ude43)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1 - There is Ethereum in Space**\n\nIn 2021, blockchain startup SpaceChain launched the first Ethereum node in space. By extending the Ethereum network beyond Earth, the project aims to enhance the security and resilience of blockchain technology\u00a0by eliminating the reliance on centralised infrastructure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2 - Ethereum is a Turing-Complete Language**\n\nEthereum is a Turing complete blockchain, meaning developers can write programs or smart contracts that can solve any reasonable computational problem.\n\nThey can use\u00a0Solidity and Serpent to perform looping and branching statements and local state storage. This functionality is important to have to implement most non-trivial computer programs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3 - Ethereum\u2019s \u2018Minimal Issuance\u2019 Supply Cap**\n\nIn contrast to\u00a0Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply cap, Ethereum\u2019s supply is not limited. However, there is a mechanism known as the \u201cminimum viable issuance,\u201d which aims to balance the inflation rate of Ether (ETH) to secure the network and incentivise validators.\u00a0\n\nThe issuance rate is adjusted through\u00a0Ethereum Improvement Proposal\u00a0(EIPs) and community consensus. Furthermore, as part of EIP-1559, a portion of ETH is burned as a base fee, which has brought an element of deflation to the cryptocurrency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4 - Ethereum was crowdfunded**\n\nEthereum is the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, who created the network\u2019s whitepaper in 2013. Back then, Buterin did not have the funds to commence developments and had to reach out for finance. However, instead of turning to venture capital firms, he and his co-founders decided to go down the crowdfunding route, a mode of finance that was popular among artists and social entrepreneurship projects at the time. The crowdfunding campaign was a huge success. Buterin collected the required funds in just a couple of months (July and August 2014), and the Ethereum project was finally launched on 30 July 2015.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5 - Testnets named after metro stations**\n\nTest networks (testnets) are backup blockchains. They are used to test changes and updates before they go live on the main network. Ethereum has 5 testnets, namely Sepolia, Goerli, Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan. Interestingly, these testnets are named after metro and train stations worldwide. Kovan is an MRT station in Singapore, Rinkeby and Ropsten are stations on the blue and red lines of the Stockholm metro, respectively, Sepolia is a stop on the Athens Metro Line 2, and finally, Goerli was named after a train station in Berlin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6 - Ethereum is supported by large businesses.**\u00a0\n\nIt is not only the programmers and investors who have shown their interest in Ethereum and is looking for ways to use the functionality. Massive tech companies have also found the use of Etherium in their respective fields. Some of the most famous companies are Samsung SDS, Toyota Research Institute, Banco Santander, Microsoft, J.P.Morgan, Merck GAA, Intel, Deloitte, DTCC, ING, Accenture, Consensys, Bank of Canada and BNY Mellon.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7 - Ethereum was inspired by Anime**\n\nIt is Hayao Miyazaki, a Japanese animator, director and manga artist whose work, \u201cLaputa: Castle In The Sky\u201d, served as an inspiration for Vitalik Buterin.\n\nOne of the anime heroes used the magic crystal Aethereum, which made it possible to extract energy from the air.

{"selftext":"In the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, the concept of gold-backed digital tokens stands out and represents a beacon of stability and trust. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, the foundation of these digital currencies rests on the age-old reliability of gold, combining the time-tested value of precious metals with the efficiency and security of blockchain technology. Gold-backed cryptocurrencies operate on the principle of tying digital tokens to physical gold stored in secure vaults. \n\n**How it works**\n\nEach unit of the cryptocurrency represents a specific quantity of gold, bringing the stability and intrinsic value of the precious metal into the digital realm. \n\nThis linkage to a tangible asset sets gold-backed cryptocurrencies apart from their purely digital counterparts, offering a level of security and trust that resonates with both seasoned investors and newcomers to the digital asset space. Let's explore why they're seen as the future of digital assets.\n\n**Benefits of Gold-Backed Digital Tokens**\n\n**1. Stability and Trust:** Gold has been a symbol of wealth and stability for centuries. By linking digital tokens to gold, investors enjoy the security of a physical asset with the flexibility of digital technology.\n\n**2. Reduced Volatility:**\n\nIn times of economic uncertainty, gold has historically served as a safe-haven asset. Gold-backed cryptocurrencies offer a modern-day version of this financial refuge, allowing investors to hedge against inflation and economic instability. The inherent stability of gold also helps cushion these digital tokens against the wild price swings common in the cryptocurrency market, making them a more stable investment option.\n\n**3. Transparency and Traceability:** \n\nBlockchain technology ensures that each transaction is recorded, providing a transparent and secure ownership trail.\n\n**4. Accessibility and Liquidity:** \n\nGold-backed cryptocurrencies facilitate borderless transactions, allowing users to trade and transfer value seamlessly across the globe. This accessibility eliminates traditional barriers associated with cross-border transactions, opening new avenues for international trade and investment and provides liquidity that is often superior to physical gold.\n\n**5. Regulatory Compliance:** \n\nMany gold-backed digital tokens comply with stringent regulatory standards, offering a layer of security and trust for investors.\n\n**6. Portfolio Diversification:** \n\nInvestors often seek diverse assets to mitigate risk. Gold-backed cryptocurrencies provide an opportunity to diversify digital asset portfolios, combining the potential for capital appreciation with the stability of precious metals.\n\n**Future Outlook**\n\nAs the financial landscape evolves, gold-backed cryptocurrencies are poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of digital assets. Their unique blend of stability, security, and intrinsic value positions them as a reliable choice for investors seeking a balance between traditional and modern form of wealth preservation. The ability to bridge the gap between the tangible and digital worlds makes gold-backed cryptocurrencies a formidable contender in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n**Examples of Gold-backed cryptocurrencies**\n\nDAU exemplifies the benefits of gold-backed digital assets. DAU is issued by Du Bois Gold AG (DuBois), a company registered and operating in Switzerland. DAU represents title to and ownership of physical kilobars of LBMA-accredited 9999 gold bullion. DAU offers investors the perks of gold investment without the logistical challenges, and is never loaned, pledged, or encumbered in any way. This policy ensures that for each unit of DAU, the corresponding kilobar of LBMA-accredited gold can always be collected, differentiating DAU from other gold backed cryptocurrencies.\n\n**Tether Gold (XAUT)**\n\nTether Gold (XAUT) was launched by Tether. Each XAUT token represents one troy ounce of physical gold stored in a Swiss vault, and offers a stable and secure way for individuals and institutions to invest in gold digitally. XAUT is redeemable for physical gold, and users can trade it on various exchanges.\n\n**PAX Gold (PAXG)**\n\nPax Gold (PAXG) is a gold-backed cryptocurrency launched by Paxos Standard (PAX) creators. It operates as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, making it widely tradeable on various exchanges. PAXG is backed by real gold reserves held by Paxos, a New York-based for-profit company, with each token redeemable for one troy fine ounce of gold custodied in vaults and is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).\n\nThe foundation of gold-backed cryptocurrencies represents a significant stride toward a more secure and stable digital asset landscape. Gold-backed tokens like DAU are poised to play a significant role, offering a bridge between traditional asset classes and the digital future offering investors a compelling avenue for diversification and wealth preservation.","title":"Understanding the Foundation of Gold-Backed Digital Assets","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1701279156,"id":"186v1r0"}

The announcement comes amid growing regulatory pressure on the asset\u2019s issuer Paxos. Binance advised users to withdraw or convert any BUSD holdings into alternative cryptocurrencies. In addition, it touted conversion to its  own FDUSD stablecoin as an option at a 1:1 ratio with no trading fees.\n\nThe wind-down marks continued fallout from the New York Department of  Financial Services ordering Paxos to stop minting BUSD in February over undisclosed concerns.\n\nThe exchange will disable withdrawals by December 31st and automatically shift all remaining customer balances into FDUSD without  additional fees.\n\nThe announcement clarified that BUSD assets can still be deposited  and manually swapped for FDUSD until further notice, despite other functionality ending. In addition, the 1:1 conversion ensures stable  value is preserved without disruption for customers caught in the shuffle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","title":"Binance is no longer supporting BUSD","upvote_ratio":1.0,"score":1,"total_awards_received":0,"num_comments":1,"created":1701287539,"id":"186ydgf"}
